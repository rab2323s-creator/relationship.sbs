      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        relationship.sbs is created and maintained by <strong>Laura Aram Smith, PhD</strong>, a psychologist.
        The site is designed for people who want clear relationship language and usable tools—not vague advice or hype.
      </p>

      <h2>Research & sources</h2>
      <p>
        Our content is informed by established relationship psychology concepts, including attachment theory,
        emotional regulation, boundary-setting, and conflict repair frameworks. We focus on practical guidance that can
        be used in real conversations.
      </p>

      <h2>Editorial approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity over hype:</strong> practical guidance, no unrealistic promises.</li>
        <li><strong>Usefulness first:</strong> steps you can apply immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> we avoid one-size-fits-all advice.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> we refine content based on feedback and performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Corrections & feedback</h2>
