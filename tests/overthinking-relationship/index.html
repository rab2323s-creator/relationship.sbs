      <h2>Overthinking relationship test: the moment your brain starts “solving” love</h2>
      <p>If you’ve searched <strong>“overthinking my relationship”</strong>, <strong>“relationship anxiety”</strong>, or <strong>“why do I overthink texts?”</strong>, you already know the pattern: one small uncertainty becomes a full mental investigation. This quiz is built to identify <em>your exact loop</em>—so you can calm it with actions, not more analysis.</p>

      <h3>What this overthinking test measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reassurance loops:</strong> needing confirmation to feel safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Mind-reading:</strong> decoding tone, timing, and micro-signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Rumination:</strong> replaying conversations to find a hidden meaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypervigilance:</strong> scanning for danger before it happens.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-trust:</strong> whether uncertainty makes you doubt your reality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Most searched questions (answered inside your result)</h3>
      <div class="faq">
        <details><summary>Why do I overthink everything in my relationship?</summary><p>Because uncertainty is your trigger—your brain tries to create control by analyzing. The fix is not “think harder,” it’s clearer requests + nervous-system regulation.</p></details>
        <details><summary>How do I stop overthinking texts?</summary><p>Decide a rule before you’re triggered: one check-in + a time boundary. Then shift to body calming (walk, breathing) so your brain stops treating silence as danger.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Is overthinking a sign of insecurity?</summary><p>Often it’s a sign of <em>safety needs</em>. Sometimes it’s personal anxiety; sometimes it’s an inconsistent relationship. Your result helps you separate the two.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Is it intuition or anxiety?</summary><p>Intuition is usually calm and specific. Anxiety is loud, urgent, and story-heavy. This test helps you spot which one is driving you.</p></details>
