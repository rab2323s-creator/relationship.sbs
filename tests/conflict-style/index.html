  <h2>Conflict style test (deep profile)</h2>
  <p>This conflict style quiz focuses on what people actually search: <em>why you shut down</em>, <em>why you get defensive</em>, and <em>how to fight fair</em>. Your result includes your top style, your runner‑up, and the nervous‑system triggers that make you predictable in arguments.</p>

  <h3>What this test measures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your top 2 conflict styles (avoid/compete/accommodate/compromise/collaborate).</li>
    <li>Modifiers like shutdown, defensiveness, or over‑apologizing.</li>
    <li>Repair scripts you can use in real conversations.</li>
  </ul>

<details><summary>Why do I shut down during arguments?</summary><p>Often it’s flooding: your body goes into freeze/withdraw, making words hard to access.</p></details>

<details><summary>What are the 5 conflict styles?</summary><p>Avoiding, competing, accommodating, compromising, and collaborating.</p></details>
<details><summary>What does collaborating look like?</summary><p>Curiosity, validation, one issue at a time, and ending with a concrete next step.</p></details>
<details><summary>What does avoiding look like?</summary><p>Withdrawing, delaying, going quiet, or changing topics when conflict heats up.</p></details>
<details><summary>What does competing look like?</summary><p>High directness, pushing your point, debate energy, prioritizing outcomes.</p></details>
<details><summary>What does accommodating look like?</summary><p>Keeping peace, apologizing quickly, minimizing your needs.</p></details>
<details><summary>What does compromising look like?</summary><p>Meeting in the middle and getting a workable solution fast.</p></details>
<details><summary>Is avoiding conflict always bad?</summary><p>No. Space is healthy if you return. Vanishing without repair erodes trust.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do I get defensive?</summary><p>Defensiveness is self-protection when you feel blamed or unsafe.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I stop being defensive?</summary><p>Validate one point first, then explain. Defend less, clarify more.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I stop escalating fights?</summary><p>Slow your body down, lower volume, stick to one issue, and call a time-out early.</p></details>
<details><summary>What is fair fighting?</summary><p>No insults, one issue at a time, time-outs with return time, and a clear repair step.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do we repair after conflict?</summary><p>Acknowledge impact → reassure safety → agree on one behavior change.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do we keep having the same fight?</summary><p>The surface topic changes, but the unmet need or boundary stays the same.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I communicate with someone who shuts down?</summary><p>Offer a pause + return time, reduce intensity, and ask for one sentence of engagement.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I communicate with someone who escalates?</summary><p>Stay calm, set tone boundaries, and ask for one concrete request instead of accusations.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can two different conflict styles work?</summary><p>Yes—if both can name their style and agree on shared rules for repair.</p></details>
<details><summary>What’s the best conflict style quiz?</summary><p>One that identifies top two styles and gives specific repair scripts, not vague advice.</p></details>
<details><summary>Is silent treatment emotional abuse?</summary><p>It can be if used to punish/control. A regulated time-out with return time is different.</p></details>
<details><summary>What’s the difference between a time-out and avoidance?</summary><p>A time-out includes a return time and commitment to repair; avoidance is indefinite.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do I freeze in conflict?</summary><p>Freeze is a threat response. Your brain prioritizes safety over speech.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I stop freezing?</summary><p>Regulate first (breathing, grounding), then speak in one sentence at a time.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I bring up issues without starting a fight?</summary><p>Use one behavior + one impact + one request. No global character attacks.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I apologize effectively?</summary><p>Name impact, take responsibility, and state the new behavior you’ll try.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why does tone matter so much?</summary><p>Tone signals safety. Many people can’t hear content if tone feels hostile.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I set boundaries in conflict?</summary><p>Be specific, calm, and consistent. Boundaries are actions you control.</p></details>
<details><summary>What if my partner refuses to repair?</summary><p>That’s a bigger issue than style. No style works without mutual effort.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I handle conflict in long distance?</summary><p>Use scheduled talks, time-outs with return time, and written agreements.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do I go for ‘logic’ in fights?</summary><p>Logic can be protection. Add validation so logic doesn’t become dismissal.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do I apologize too much?</summary><p>Over-apologizing can be a safety strategy. It stops tension but doesn’t solve needs.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I stop over-apologizing?</summary><p>Replace automatic sorry with: ‘I hear you. Here’s what I can do.’</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do I avoid bringing things up?</summary><p>If conflict feels unsafe, your system prioritizes peace over truth.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I stop avoiding?</summary><p>Start with small issues, use scripts, and set a short time-boxed conversation.</p></details>
<details><summary>What’s a repair script?</summary><p>A sentence that lowers threat and moves toward a solution (example: ‘I care; I’m flooded; I will return at 7.’).</p></details>
<details><summary>Can conflict styles change?</summary><p>Yes—skills, safety, and repeated repair can shift your default responses.</p></details>
<details><summary>Is conflict healthy?</summary><p>Yes—if it’s repaired. The damage comes from contempt, stonewalling, and no repair.</p></details>
<details><summary>What’s one habit that fixes most fights?</summary><p>Time-outs with return time + a weekly check-in ritual.</p></details>
