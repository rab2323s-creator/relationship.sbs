      <h1>Healthy Influence — Your Boundaries Don’t Cost You Love</h1>

      <p class="note">
        This profile points to a dynamic where disagreements don’t erase your reality. Boundaries are treated as normal,
        and repair means follow-through—not confusion, punishment, or “payback energy.”

        <h2>What This Result Means</h2>
        <p>
          Your answers suggest a relationship where influence is mutual, not controlling. When something hurts, it can be named
          without turning into a courtroom. You don’t have to perfect your wording to be taken seriously, and “repair” is not just
          an apology—it’s a visible shift in behavior over time.
        </p>

        <div class="pull">
          <p>
            The quiet marker of this profile is simple: you can stay yourself while staying connected.
            You don’t have to shrink your needs to keep the peace.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>A short story that fits this profile</h2>
        <h3>Respect is the default setting</h3>
        <p>
          You bring up something small. They don’t love hearing it—but they don’t punish you for saying it.
          The conversation stays on the issue. You feel seen, not cross-examined. Later, you notice a real change:
          a different tone, a new habit, a small effort that repeats.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s not perfection. That’s emotional reliability: the sense that honesty won’t cost you closeness.
        </p>

        <h2>What This Usually Looks Like</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Safe honesty:</strong> you can name discomfort without bracing for backlash.</li>
          <li><strong>Repair with action:</strong> apologies tend to be followed by concrete follow-through.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundaries are normal:</strong> limits don’t trigger guilt, withdrawal, or a “punishment phase.”</li>
          <li><strong>Reality stays intact:</strong> your feelings aren’t treated like a debate to win.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Blind Spots</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Assuming everyone feels safe the same way you do:</strong> your standards may be healthier than the people around you.</li>
          <li><strong>Under-addressing small frictions:</strong> even good dynamics benefit from early, simple repair.</li>
          <li><strong>Over-functioning “because it’s easy”:</strong> sometimes you carry extra emotional labor just because you can.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">

        <h2>Helpful Scripts</h2>
        <h3>Short lines that reinforce a healthy pattern</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>“I appreciate how we can repair things directly.”</li>
          <li>“Can we pick one small change and check in next week?”</li>
          <li>“Let’s stay on one issue and one agreement—then follow through.”</li>
          <li>“Thank you for hearing me. It helps me feel safe with you.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
        <h3>Protect what’s working</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Name needs early</strong> (small repairs prevent big resets).</li>
          <li><strong>Keep repair specific:</strong> one agreement, one behavior, one follow-through.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain a full life:</strong> friendships, routines, and meaning outside the relationship.</li>
          <li><strong>Stay honest about drift:</strong> if respect slips under stress, address it quickly and calmly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>One-minute takeaway</h2>
        <p>
          The best sign here isn’t “no conflict.” It’s <strong>repair without consequences</strong>.
          When honesty doesn’t cost connection, the relationship has emotional safety.
        </p>

        <h3>If you only do one thing</h3>
        <p class="callout">
          Keep repair small and specific: one issue, one agreement, one follow-through.
        </p>
