<h1>Healthy Influence — Your Boundaries Don’t Cost You Love</h1>

<h2>What This Result Means</h2>
<p>
Your answers suggest a relationship where influence is mutual, not controlling.
Disagreements don’t erase your reality, and repair leads to visible effort—not confusion.
This doesn’t mean everything is perfect. It means <strong>you don’t lose yourself to keep peace</strong>.
</p>

<h2>What This Usually Looks Like</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can name discomfort without fear of punishment.</li>
  <li>Apologies are followed by changed behavior.</li>
  <li>Boundaries don’t trigger guilt or withdrawal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Blind Spots</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Assuming others experience safety the same way you do.</li>
  <li>Downplaying small issues until they stack up.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helpful Scripts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“I appreciate how we can repair things directly.”</li>
  <li>“Let’s agree on one small change and check in next week.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
Protect this dynamic by naming needs early, keeping repair specific,
and maintaining a life outside the relationship.
