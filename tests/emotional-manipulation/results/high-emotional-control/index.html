        This profile reflects a dynamic where honesty consistently comes with consequences.
        It’s not about one argument—it’s about a pattern where speaking up reliably triggers
        guilt, withdrawal, coldness, or escalation.

        <h2>What This Result Means</h2>
        <p>
          In a high emotional control dynamic, the cost of honesty is predictably high.
          You may notice that raising needs, boundaries, or concerns leads to fallout:
          silence, distance, anger, guilt, or a sense that you must “fix” the situation.
        </p>

        <div class="pull">
          <p>
            Over time, the nervous system adapts. You speak less. You pre-edit more.
            You start measuring safety by how quiet things are—rather than how honest you can be.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>A short story that captures the pattern</h2>
        <h3>Peace becomes conditional</h3>
        <p>
          You scan the room before you speak. You sense shifts in tone and adjust quickly.
          When you stay agreeable, things are calm. When you assert yourself, something is taken away:
          warmth, closeness, cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, your body learns the rule: <em>connection is safest when I’m smaller</em>.
          That rule, not any single argument, is the harm.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Experiences</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Walking on eggshells:</strong> monitoring mood, timing, and wording.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional management:</strong> feeling responsible for their reactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-doubt:</strong> questioning your memory, feelings, or judgment.</li>
          <li><strong>Shrinking:</strong> giving up needs to avoid consequences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Is Serious Data</h2>
        <p>
          Healthy relationships can tolerate discomfort. High-control dynamics cannot.
          When honesty reliably leads to punishment, emotional safety is compromised.
          This isn’t about intent—it’s about impact and repetition.
        </p>

        <div class="warning">
          <p class="note" style="margin:0;">
            If you feel persistently anxious, confused, or afraid to speak,
            prioritize support outside the relationship.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Protective Scripts</h2>
        <h3>Use only if it feels safe to do so</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>“I’m pausing this conversation to protect myself.”</li>
          <li>“I’m not available for guilt or blame-shifting.”</li>
          <li>“We can talk when respect is present.”</li>
          <li>“I need consistency, not pressure.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="protective-steps">Protective Next Steps</h2>
        <h3>Focus on clarity and safety—not persuasion</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Document patterns:</strong> dates, behaviors, outcomes. This protects your reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Set one non-negotiable boundary</strong> and observe what happens.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce over-explaining:</strong> it often increases control, not understanding.</li>
          <li><strong>Strengthen external support:</strong> friends, routines, professional help.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="note">
          This is an educational result, not a diagnosis.
          If distress feels intense or persistent, consider speaking with a licensed professional or trusted support.
        </p>

        <h2>One-minute grounding</h2>
        <p>
          If honesty feels dangerous, pause. Your job is not to explain better—
          it’s to protect your wellbeing and clarity.
        </p>

        <h3>If you only do one thing</h3>
        <p class="callout">
          Notice whether respect improves when you stop over-explaining.
