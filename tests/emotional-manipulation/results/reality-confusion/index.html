<h1>Reality Confusion Signals — Your Feelings Keep Getting Rewritten</h1>

<h2>What This Result Means</h2>
<p>
You may leave conversations feeling uncertain, guilty, or unsure whether your feelings are “valid.”
The issue isn’t disagreement—it’s that your reality keeps becoming negotiable.
</p>

<h2>Common Patterns</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Being told you’re “too sensitive” instead of being heard.</li>
  <li>Detail debates that erase the bigger pattern.</li>
  <li>Over-explaining to feel believed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Is Draining</h2>
<p>
When your emotions become a logic puzzle, self-trust erodes.
Confusion becomes the cost of connection.
</p>

<h2>Helpful Scripts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“I’m not debating my feelings. I’m naming impact.”</li>
  <li>“Let’s stay on one issue and one agreement.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
Document patterns privately.
Set limits around circular conversations.
Clarity is protection—not aggression.
