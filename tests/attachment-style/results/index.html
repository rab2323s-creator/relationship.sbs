        If you’ve ever read a slow reply like a crime scene, gone quiet after closeness, or felt panic when a conversation stayed “unfinished,”
        you’re not broken—you’re patterned. These are the four attachment style results, explained in real-life language.

      <h2>What these results actually measure</h2>
      <p>
        This test maps two forces that shape relationship behavior under stress:
        <strong>attachment anxiety</strong> (how fast your alarm activates) and <strong>attachment avoidance</strong> (how strongly you protect space).
        Most “drama” isn’t drama—it’s protection: protection from abandonment, from overwhelm, or from vulnerability.
      </p>

      <h2>Pick the result you want to understand</h2>

        Each profile below links to a full result page with practical scripts, repair moves, and “what to do today” steps.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Texting:</strong> you don’t panic over delays; you ask directly if you need clarity.</li>

            <li><strong>Texting:</strong> tone + timing become “signals.” Silence becomes a story.</li>
            <li><strong>Closeness:</strong> bonding is fast; you want momentum and clarity.</li>

            <li><strong>Texting:</strong> you stay practical when things feel too vulnerable.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Texting:</strong> you want contact, then feel exposed—so you pull back or test.</li>
            <li><strong>Closeness:</strong> intimacy feels healing, then suddenly “too much.”</li>

      <h2>Two myths that keep people stuck</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth #1:</strong> “If they love me, I shouldn’t need to ask.” Reality: secure love is built on clear requests, not mind-reading.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth #2:</strong> “If I pull away, it means I don’t care.” Reality: distance can be a stress response—not a lack of feelings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to do next (the best internal path)</h2>
      <p>
        Once you know your attachment result, the fastest progress comes from understanding your communication pattern under stress.
        Choose a next step based on what hits hardest for you:

      <h2>Small truth, big relief</h2>
      <p>
        Your attachment style result is not your identity. It’s your <strong>default strategy</strong> when you feel unsafe.
        And strategies can change—especially when you replace guessing with clarity, and conflict with repair.
