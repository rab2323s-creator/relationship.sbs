      <h2>What this attachment style quiz measures</h2>
      <p><strong>Attachment style</strong> describes how you react to closeness, distance, and uncertainty in relationships—especially under stress. This quick attachment style quiz is not a diagnosis. It’s a practical snapshot of patterns many people recognize: <em>anxious attachment</em>, <em>avoidant attachment</em>, and <em>secure attachment</em>.</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever googled “<strong>why do I get anxious when they don’t text back</strong>” or “<strong>why do I shut down in conflict</strong>,” you’re already describing attachment behavior. The goal is simple: name the pattern, then practice the smallest next step that changes outcomes.</p>

      <h3>How to read your result</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure-leaning</strong>: you can tolerate uncertainty, communicate needs, and repair after conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>Anxious-leaning</strong>: you seek reassurance when connection feels shaky; uncertainty can trigger overthinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoidant-leaning</strong>: you protect independence when emotions rise; you may withdraw to feel safe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What to do next (practical, fast)</h3>
      <p>Most relationship problems aren’t “lack of love”—they’re <strong>misread signals</strong> plus missing skills. Use your result as a starting point and try one of these:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>One clear request</strong>: “When we don’t talk all day, I feel distant. Can we check in tonight?”</li>
        <li><strong>One time-bound pause</strong>: “I’m overwhelmed. I need 30 minutes, then I’ll come back.”</li>
        <li><strong>One repair</strong>: “I got defensive. I want to restart. Here’s what I meant…”</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Common myths (that keep you stuck)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “If it’s real love, it’s effortless.” <strong>Reality:</strong> secure love is skilled love.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “I’m just a jealous person.” <strong>Reality:</strong> anxiety often needs reassurance + boundaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> “Needing space means you don’t care.” <strong>Reality:</strong> space can be healthy when communicated.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>What this attachment style test measures</h2>
  <p>
    This quick <strong>attachment style quiz</strong> is designed to estimate how you react to closeness, distance,
    and conflict in romantic relationships. Attachment style is not a diagnosis. It’s a practical model used in
    relationship psychology to explain patterns like seeking reassurance (anxious attachment),
    pulling away under pressure (avoidant attachment), or staying steady while communicating needs (secure attachment).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’ve ever searched for <em>“why do I get anxious when they don’t text back?”</em> or
    <em>“why do I shut down in relationships?”</em>, this test helps you name the pattern — then gives you a concrete next step.
  </p>

  <h2>How to read your results (secure / anxious / avoidant)</h2>
  <div class="grid2">
    <div class="mini">
      <h3>Secure-leaning</h3>
      <p>Comfortable with intimacy and independence. You can ask for what you need without escalation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mini">
      <h3>Anxious-leaning</h3>
      <p>Highly sensitive to uncertainty. You may seek reassurance, overthink, and chase closure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mini">
      <h3>Avoidant-leaning</h3>
      <p>Protects autonomy when emotions intensify. You may disengage, minimize needs, or go emotionally quiet.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Practical relationship advice based on your pattern</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>If you’re anxious:</strong> reduce “panic texting”, ask directly for one need, and build self-soothing routines.</li>
    <li><strong>If you’re avoidant:</strong> communicate pauses (don’t disappear), practice emotional naming, and return to the conversation.</li>
    <li><strong>If you’re secure:</strong> keep your standards, model calm communication, and avoid “fixing” others at your expense.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common signs you might have an anxious or avoidant attachment style</h2>
  <div class="grid2">
    <div class="mini">
      <h3>Anxious attachment signs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Overthinking texts and tone</li>
        <li>Feeling rejected easily</li>
        <li>Seeking constant reassurance</li>
        <li>Difficulty relaxing when uncertain</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="mini">
      <h3>Avoidant attachment signs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Shutting down during conflict</li>
        <li>Needing lots of distance after intimacy</li>
        <li>Feeling “trapped” by commitment</li>
        <li>Keeping emotions private</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>FAQ — Attachment style quiz</h2>
  <details><summary>Can attachment style change?</summary><p>Yes. With awareness, healthy partners, and consistent behavior change, people often shift toward security over time.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Is this test scientifically accurate?</summary><p>It’s a fast educational tool, not a clinical assessment. It helps identify patterns and gives practical guidance.</p></details>
  <details><summary>What if my partner has a different attachment style?</summary><p>That’s common. The key is learning each other’s triggers and building clear communication around distance, reassurance, and conflict repair.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why do I feel anxious when someone takes space?</summary><p>Anxious attachment is often triggered by uncertainty. The nervous system treats distance like danger, so you seek closeness to feel safe.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Why do I avoid intimacy even when I like someone?</summary><p>Avoidant attachment often associates closeness with loss of autonomy or emotional overwhelm, which triggers withdrawal as a coping strategy.</p></details>
  <details><summary>What should I do right after taking this test?</summary><p>Share your result with a partner or friend, then choose one behavior to practice for 7 days (e.g., direct request, scheduled pause, or calm repair).</p></details>
