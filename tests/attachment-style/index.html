      <h2>What this test measures</h2>
      <p>
        This attachment style quiz is built around real relationship moments people actually Google: slow replies,
        pull-away after closeness, shutdown during conflict, and the “are we okay?” spiral.
        Your result is <strong>not a diagnosis</strong>—it’s a practical profile to help you communicate with less guessing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attachment anxiety:</strong> how quickly your alarm system activates (abandonment sensitivity).</li>
        <li><strong>Attachment avoidance:</strong> how strongly you protect independence under emotional pressure (distance / shutdown).</li>
        <li><strong>Modifiers:</strong> texting spirals, closeness hangover, push-pull pattern, and repair style.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real scenarios this quiz covers</h2>
      <p>
        The items below are <strong>example situations</strong> (written differently from the quiz wording) so you can see what you’re measuring:
        your pattern under uncertainty, closeness, and repair.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Slow replies:</strong> do you seek reassurance, run mental stories, or detach to regain control?</li>
        <li><strong>After a great date:</strong> do you lean in, feel crowded, or swing between craving and retreat?</li>
        <li><strong>During conflict:</strong> do you push for resolution now, shut down, or need a timed pause to return?</li>
        <li><strong>Mixed signals:</strong> do you chase clarity, test the bond, or go quiet to self-protect?</li>
        <li><strong>Repair:</strong> what makes an apology “real” to you—words, actions, consistency, or follow-through?</li>
      </ul>

        <details><summary>Is it love or attachment?</summary><p>Love can be calm; attachment anxiety feels urgent. Healthy love includes repair and respect.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Can attachment style explain jealousy?</summary><p>Often yes—jealousy can be a protection strategy when safety feels uncertain.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Why do I feel unsafe in healthy relationships?</summary><p>If your baseline expects unpredictability, calm can feel unfamiliar—not necessarily wrong.</p></details>
        <details><summary>How do I know if I’m the avoidant one?</summary><p>If closeness triggers pressure, you minimize needs, and you go quiet or detach during conflict.</p></details>
        <details><summary>How do I know if I’m the anxious one?</summary><p>If uncertainty hijacks your mood, you scan for signs, and you seek reassurance to regulate.</p></details>

        <details><summary>What’s a repair ritual?</summary><p>A consistent mini-process after tension: acknowledge impact → reassure → one next step.</p></details>

        <details><summary>Can a secure person become avoidant?</summary><p>Yes—repeated conflict without repair can push people into emotional self-protection.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Why do I test people instead of asking directly?</summary><p>Testing reduces vulnerability, but it increases confusion and distrust long-term.</p></details>
        <details><summary>What if my partner refuses to talk about this?</summary><p>Skip labels and ask behaviors: ‘What helps you feel safe to talk and repair?’</p></details>
        <details><summary>Is this test scientific?</summary><p>It’s based on established attachment frameworks; it’s not a clinical assessment.</p></details>
        <details><summary>How do I use this result with my partner?</summary><p>Share your result and pick one weekly experiment: reassurance rule, time-out rule, or check-in ritual.</p></details>

      <h2>How to use your result today</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick one repair rule:</strong> time-outs must include a return time.</li>
        <li><strong>Make one measurable request:</strong> “Can you text me when you’re busy so I don’t spiral?”</li>
        <li><strong>Translate effort:</strong> distance can be self-protection; pursuit can be fear—not manipulation.</li>
      </ol>
