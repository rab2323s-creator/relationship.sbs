  <h2>Toxic Relationship Test: the 12 questions people avoid asking themselves</h2>
  <p>If you’ve been Googling <strong>“am I in a toxic relationship?”</strong> it’s rarely because you’re bored. It’s because something feels <em>off</em>: you shrink, you second-guess, you walk on eggshells, or you keep apologizing just to restore peace. This test is built to cut through confusion—fast.</p>

  <h3>What this toxic relationship quiz measures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reality erosion:</strong> gaslighting, minimization, blame-shifting.</li>
    <li><strong>Control signals:</strong> isolation, monitoring, coercion, intimidation.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional safety:</strong> whether conflict leads to repair—or punishment.</li>
    <li><strong>Effort balance:</strong> who carries the relationship day-to-day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why these questions start strong</h3>
  <p>Most quizzes start vague. This one starts where real people live: the moment your body tightens before you speak, the moment your needs get called “too much,” the moment the story flips and you’re suddenly the villain. Each question is scenario-based so you can recognize patterns, not just labels.</p>

  <h3>Important note</h3>
  <p>This is not a clinical diagnosis. It’s a reflection tool based on behavior patterns. If you feel unsafe, controlled, or intimidated, take that signal seriously and prioritize support.</p>
