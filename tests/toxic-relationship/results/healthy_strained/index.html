  <h2>Healthy but Strained (repair is possible)</h2>
  <p>The foundation has respect, but stress patterns are getting loud.</p>

  <h3>What to do next</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do a weekly 15‑minute check‑in: one appreciation + one request + one plan.</li><li>Agree on a conflict rule: no insults, no threats, and time‑outs with return time.</li><li>If the same issue repeats 3 times, bring in a neutral third party (therapy/coaching).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Quick reality-check</h3>
  <p>If you’re unsure, re-read your answers like they were about a friend. What advice would you give them?</p>
