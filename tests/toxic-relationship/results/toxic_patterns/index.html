  <h2>Toxic Patterns Present (your reality and needs are being eroded)</h2>
  <p>You’re dealing with repeated invalidation, blame-shifting, or guilt control.</p>

  <h3>What to do next</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Name the pattern (gaslighting, guilt, blame shift) and stop debating your feelings.</li><li>Keep a private reality-check note: what happened, what was said, how you felt.</li><li>Talk to a trusted friend/therapist for external grounding and planning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Quick reality-check</h3>
  <p>If you’re unsure, re-read your answers like they were about a friend. What advice would you give them?</p>
