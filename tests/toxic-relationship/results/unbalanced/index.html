  <h2>Unbalanced / One‑Sided (you’re carrying the relationship)</h2>
  <p>The relationship runs on your effort — your partner coasts.</p>

  <h3>What to do next</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Stop over-explaining. Make one clear request, then watch behavior.</li><li>Set a timeline: if effort doesn’t change in 30 days, make a decision.</li><li>Rebuild your support system (friends, routines, hobbies) so the relationship isn’t your only oxygen.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Quick reality-check</h3>
  <p>If you’re unsure, re-read your answers like they were about a friend. What advice would you give them?</p>
