<h1>Trauma Bond Pattern — Signs You May Be Trauma Bonded</h1>

<h2>Warning Signs of Trauma Bonding in a Toxic Relationship</h2>

<p>
Your results suggest a pattern consistent with trauma bonding.
This often involves intermittent reinforcement — cycles of emotional distress followed by sudden affection.
The relief feels powerful, and that relief strengthens the attachment.
</p>

<h3>Common Signs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hot and cold behavior creates emotional dependency.</li>
<li>You feel withdrawal-like anxiety during silence.</li>
<li>Affection returns right when you're about to detach.</li>
<li>You struggle with “Why can’t I leave?”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why It Feels Addictive</h3>
<p>
Intermittent reinforcement activates powerful attachment responses.
The brain bonds strongly to unpredictable rewards.
This isn’t weakness — it’s pattern learning.
</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Track behavior patterns, not promises.</li>
<li>Delay reactions during emotional spikes.</li>
<li>Rebuild support outside the relationship.</li>
</ul>
