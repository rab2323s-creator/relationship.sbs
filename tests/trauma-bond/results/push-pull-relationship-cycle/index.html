<h1>Push–Pull Relationship Cycle — Hot and Cold Attachment Pattern</h1>

<p>
Push–pull dynamics create emotional intensity through unpredictability.
Closeness is followed by distance, then closeness again.
This pattern strengthens attachment through uncertainty.
</p>

<h2>Common Push–Pull Signs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Intense affection followed by withdrawal.</li>
<li>Frequent confusion after good moments.</li>
<li>Emotional highs and lows feel extreme.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Breaking the Cycle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask for predictable communication.</li>
<li>Do not chase during withdrawal.</li>
<li>Measure consistency over intensity.</li>
</ul>
