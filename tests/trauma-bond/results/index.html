      <h1>Trauma Bond Test Results — Which Pattern Are You In?</h1>
      <p><em>Explained by psychologist Laura Aram Smith</em></p>

      <h2>Trauma Bonding, Emotional Addiction, and Push–Pull Cycles — In Plain English</h2>

      <p>
        If you landed on this page, you’re probably not looking for a label—you’re looking for a reason why something
        painful still feels hard to leave. Many people describe it as: “I know it hurts… but when it’s good, it feels
        like I can breathe again.” That’s the core of how a <strong>trauma bond</strong> can form.
      </p>

      <p>
        In psychology, <strong>intermittent reinforcement</strong> means warmth, attention, or reassurance shows up
        unpredictably—often right after distress. Over time, your nervous system can start chasing relief instead of
        choosing stability. This is why searches like <strong>signs of trauma bonding</strong>, <strong>emotional addiction in relationships</strong>,
        and <strong>why can’t I leave a toxic relationship</strong> are so common.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below are the five result profiles from the Trauma Bond Test. Each profile is a clear mirror: what the pattern
        looks like, what it does to your clarity, and what to do next—without diagnosing you or labeling your partner.

      <h2>The 5 Trauma Bond Result Profiles</h2>
      <p>Open the profile that matches your result (or read them in order to understand the spectrum from stable to high-distress cycles):</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/secure-attachment-dynamic/"><strong>Secure Attachment Dynamic</strong></a><br />
          Steadiness is normal here. Repair leads to real change, not temporary “good phases.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/intense-attachment-pattern/"><strong>Intense Attachment Pattern</strong></a><br />
          Big emotions, but you still have grounding. You can self-soothe and reality-check.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/push-pull-relationship-cycle/"><strong>Push–Pull Relationship Cycle</strong></a><br />
          Closeness feels like a gamble. The “good version” pulls you in, the drop pulls you apart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/emotional-addiction-loop/"><strong>Emotional Addiction Loop</strong></a><br />
          Relief becomes the reward. Silence can feel like withdrawal; attention feels like oxygen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/trauma-bond-pattern/"><strong>Trauma Bond Pattern</strong></a><br />
          Pain + relief repeat. Boundaries may trigger consequences, making detachment feel unusually hard.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <section class="card prose" id="how-to-use">
      <h2>How to Use Your Result (The Fastest Path to Clarity)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Track repetition:</strong> patterns reveal themselves over weeks, not single moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure consistency (not intensity):</strong> chemistry isn’t a stability metric.</li>
        <li><strong>One boundary you can keep:</strong> choose a simple limit and follow through once.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce “checking” behaviors:</strong> when anxious, delay decisions and ground first.</li>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What are the signs of trauma bonding?</h3>
      <p>
        Signs often include hot-and-cold closeness, walking on eggshells, hope resetting after brief warmth,
        and difficulty leaving despite ongoing distress. The strongest clue is repetition: the same cycle keeps returning.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is a trauma bond so hard to break?</h3>
      <p>
        When warmth appears unpredictably after distress, the nervous system can start chasing relief.
        That “relief reward” can make attachment feel addictive even when the relationship is unstable.
      </p>

      <h3>Is this a diagnosis?</h3>
      <p>
        No. These profiles are educational reflections on relationship patterns. They do not diagnose a person
        and do not replace professional support.
