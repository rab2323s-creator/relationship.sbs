      <h1>Trauma Bond Test Results — Which Attachment Pattern Are You In?</h1>

      <h2>Understanding Trauma Bonding, Emotional Addiction, and Push–Pull Cycles</h2>

      <p>
        If you’re here, you’re probably not looking for a label—you’re looking for <strong>clarity</strong>.
        Trauma bonding isn’t “being dramatic.” It’s what happens when your nervous system learns a pattern:
        <strong>distress → relief → hope reset</strong>. The relief feels powerful, and the bond deepens—not because it’s safe,
        but because it’s unpredictable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below are the five result profiles from the <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/">Trauma Bond Test</a>. Each profile explains
        what may be driving the attachment, what signs to watch for, and what to do next—without blaming you or diagnosing anyone.
      </p>

      <h2>The 5 Trauma Bond Result Profiles</h2>
      <p>
        Choose the profile that matches your result, or read them in order to understand how attachment can shift
        from stable → intense → unstable cycles.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/secure-attachment-dynamic/"><strong>Secure Attachment Dynamic</strong></a><br />
          Stability is the baseline. Repair creates real change—not temporary “good phases.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/intense-attachment-pattern/"><strong>Intense Attachment Pattern</strong></a><br />
          Big feelings, but you still have footing. Anxiety shows up, yet you can reality-check and self-soothe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/push-pull-relationship-cycle/"><strong>Push–Pull Relationship Cycle</strong></a><br />
          Hot-and-cold closeness trains your attention. You chase the “good version” and brace for the drop.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/emotional-addiction-loop/"><strong>Emotional Addiction Loop</strong></a><br />
          Relief starts to feel like oxygen. Silence triggers withdrawal-like distress and compulsive checking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/trauma-bond/results/trauma-bond-pattern/"><strong>Trauma Bond Pattern</strong></a><br />
          Pain + relief can create a powerful pull. Boundaries may trigger consequences, and leaving can feel unbearable.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Meaning / interpretive section -->
    <section class="card prose" id="what-this-means">
      <h2>What These Results Actually Mean</h2>
      <p>
        These profiles don’t measure “how much you love someone.” They measure <strong>patterns</strong>:
        consistency, repair after conflict, boundary responses, silence/withdrawal, and whether closeness is
        something you can count on—or something you have to earn.
      </p>

      <h3>Trauma bond vs. push–pull vs. healthy love</h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>push–pull cycle</strong> often feels like closeness followed by sudden distance with no clarity.
        A <strong>trauma bond</strong> usually intensifies the pull through <strong>intermittent reinforcement</strong>—
        warmth appears at key moments (often after distress), making your body chase relief.
        Healthy love is different: repair leads to stable behavior, and you don’t have to shrink to keep peace.
      </p>

    <!-- Practical next steps -->
    <section class="card prose" id="next-steps">
      <h2>Best Next Steps (Simple, Practical)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Look for repetition:</strong> track the cycle over weeks, not moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure consistency:</strong> not intensity, apologies, or chemistry.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect your nervous system:</strong> pause before reacting during peak anxiety.</li>
        <li><strong>Set one boundary you can keep:</strong> then follow through once.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If your result points to high distress, the fastest clarity often comes from mapping patterns and
        rebuilding support outside the relationship.
