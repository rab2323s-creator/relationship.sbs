      <p>
        Trauma bonding doesn’t always look dramatic. It often looks like intense closeness followed by distance,
        warmth followed by silence, and hope followed by confusion. Over time, your nervous system can learn to
        chase relief instead of stability—because relief feels like the reward.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why terms like <strong>trauma bond test</strong>, <strong>intermittent reinforcement relationship</strong>,
        and <strong>emotional addiction in relationships</strong> are searched so often: people want a clear way to name
        the pattern—without blaming themselves or labeling someone else.
      </p>

      <!-- Added: semantic authority section (10/10 topical depth) -->
      <h2>Trauma Bond vs. Push–Pull vs. Healthy Love (Quick Clarity)</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>push–pull cycle</strong> can happen when closeness triggers fear and distance triggers longing—creating
        repeated resets. A <strong>trauma bond</strong> often intensifies that pull through <strong>intermittent reinforcement</strong>:
        warmth appears unpredictably (often after distress), which can make the bond feel addictive.
        In <strong>healthy love</strong>, repair leads to consistent behavior—not a temporary “good phase.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This quiz focuses on <strong>patterns over moments</strong>: what repeats, what predicts the next drop, and how your
        body responds (calm, vigilance, relief, or withdrawal). You’ll get a profile that explains what may be driving the attachment.
