<h1>Are You Trauma Bonded in a Toxic Relationship? Take the 2-Minute Quiz to Find Out</h1>

<h2>Warning Signs of a Trauma Bond: Emotional Addiction, Intermittent Reinforcement, and Toxic Attachment Patterns</h2>

<h3>If leaving feels harder than staying — even when you're hurting — this test is for you.</h3>

<p>
A trauma bond doesn’t always look dramatic. It often looks like intense chemistry,
followed by distance. Deep connection, followed by confusion. Warmth, followed by silence.
</p>

<p>
People searching for <strong>trauma bond test</strong>, <strong>emotional addiction in relationships</strong>,
or <strong>toxic attachment patterns</strong> usually aren’t looking for drama.
They’re trying to understand why something painful feels impossible to leave.
</p>

<h2>What This Trauma Bond Test Measures</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Intermittent reinforcement patterns</li>
  <li>Emotional dependency cycles</li>
  <li>Attachment triggered by inconsistency</li>
  <li>Difficulty leaving despite emotional distress</li>
</ul>

<h2>What It Doesn’t Do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This is not a diagnosis.</li>
  <li>This does not label your partner.</li>
  <li>This is not therapy or medical advice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Results</h2>
<p>
You’ll receive one of five profiles explaining whether the attachment is healthy,
intense-but-balanced, unstable, reinforcing dependency, or likely trauma-bond driven.
</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
This quiz is for educational and self-reflection purposes only.
If distress feels severe or persistent, consider speaking with a licensed professional.
