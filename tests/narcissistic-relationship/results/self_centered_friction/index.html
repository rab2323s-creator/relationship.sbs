      <h2>Quick read (30 seconds)</h2>
      <p>
        This profile suggests a relationship where things don’t feel overtly unsafe—but they often feel
        <strong>tilted</strong>. Decisions, emotional space, or attention may drift toward one person,
        and friction shows up when you ask for balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people search <em>“my partner is selfish”</em> or <em>“why do my needs come last”</em>
        at this stage. This page helps you spot whether the imbalance is situational—or becoming a pattern.

      <h2>What self-centered friction usually looks like</h2>
      <h3>Subtle patterns that create ongoing tension</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conversations drift:</strong> discussions circle back to their priorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Partial accountability:</strong> they acknowledge issues, but change is inconsistent.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional imbalance:</strong> your needs are “later,” theirs are urgent.</li>
        <li><strong>Friction repeats:</strong> the same arguments resurface without resolution.</li>
        <li><strong>You adapt more:</strong> you compromise more often to keep things smooth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        This isn’t about one bad week. It’s about direction over time.

    <section class="card prose" id="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why this stage matters</h2>
      <h3>Because patterns either correct—or deepen</h3>
      <p>
        Self-centered friction is often a crossroads. With accountability and repair, balance can return.
        Without it, the tilt can slowly harden into manipulation or control.
        Paying attention now protects your future clarity.
      </p>

    <section class="card prose" id="scripts">
      <h2>Copy-paste scripts (early course-correction)</h2>
      <h3>Clear, calm, and hard to dismiss</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When things tilt:</strong> “I notice my needs keep getting postponed. I need us to address that.”</li>
        <li><strong>When change stalls:</strong> “We’ve talked about this before. What will be different this week?”</li>
        <li><strong>When you over-explain:</strong> “I’m going to keep this simple: this matters to me.”</li>
        <li><strong>When friction repeats:</strong> “We’re looping. I want a solution, not another round.”</li>
        <li><strong>When compromise is one-sided:</strong> “I’m willing to meet halfway—are you?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Tip: Early boundaries work best when they’re short and tracked over time.

    <section class="card prose" id="next-steps">
      <h2>Next steps (protect balance)</h2>
      <h3>Use a 2–week pattern check</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Name the imbalance:</strong> time, decisions, emotional labor.</li>
        <li><strong>Make one clear request:</strong> specific and observable.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch follow-through:</strong> balance shows in behavior, not reassurance.</li>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What does “Self-Centered Friction” mean?</h3>
      <p>
        It means your answers suggested repeated imbalance and friction, with inconsistent accountability.
        This is educational, not a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h3>Can this improve?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes—if both people adjust behavior and follow through consistently.
        If boundaries are ignored or punished, reassess the direction of the relationship.
      </p>

      <h3>When should I be concerned?</h3>
      <p>
        If friction escalates into blame shifting, reality confusion, or fear of speaking up,
        explore the <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/manipulation_flags/">Manipulation Flags</a> profile.
