      <h2>Quick answer: what these results mean</h2>
      <p>
        This page helps you compare the five most common patterns people search for:
        <strong>gaslighting</strong>, <strong>blame shifting</strong>, <strong>love bombing</strong>,
        <strong>emotional manipulation</strong>, and <strong>control</strong>.
        Use these as <strong>lenses, not labels</strong>. The key is repetition over time.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use this page (60 seconds)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start with the profile you got</strong> (or the one that feels closest).</li>
        <li><strong>Read the “scripts” section</strong> and try one boundary sentence this week.</li>
        <li><strong>Track follow-through</strong> (behavior change over time matters more than apologies).</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>All 5 result profiles (compare side-by-side)</h2>

      <section class="card prose" id="profiles">
        <h3>1) Respectful Dynamic</h3>
        <p>
          Accountability exists. Repair leads to real change. You leave conflict clearer—not smaller.
          <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/respectful_dynamic/">Read Respectful Dynamic →</a>
        </p>

        <h3>2) Self-Centered Friction</h3>
        <p>
          The relationship often tilts toward them. Your needs get deprioritized and friction repeats—this is a key crossroads stage.
          <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/self_centered_friction/">Read Self-Centered Friction →</a>
        </p>

        <h3>3) Manipulation Flags</h3>
        <p>
          Reality confusion, pressure, and blame shifting show up repeatedly. You may feel foggy after conflict and unsure what happened.
          <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/manipulation_flags/">Read Manipulation Flags →</a>
        </p>

        <h3>4) Narcissistic Pattern Likely</h3>
        <p>
          A consistent cycle: charm → conflict → blame → your apology → temporary calm → repeat. Accountability stays thin.
          <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/narcissistic_pattern_likely/">Read Narcissistic Pattern Likely →</a>
        </p>

        <h3>5) High Control &amp; Erosion</h3>
        <p>
          Boundaries trigger punishment, monitoring, or fear. Your life and self-trust may shrink over time. Includes Safety guidance.
