      <h2>How to use this page</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re trying to make sense of a confusing dynamic, reading the profiles side-by-side helps you see patterns more clearly.
        Use these as lenses, not labels.
      </p>

      <h2>All 5 Result Profiles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/respectful_dynamic/">Respectful Dynamic</a>
          — Accountability exists. Repair leads to real change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/self_centered_friction/">Self-Centered Friction</a>

          <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/narcissistic_pattern_likely/">Narcissistic Pattern Likely</a>
          — Consistent blame shifting + low accountability over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/narcissistic-relationship/results/high_control_erosion/">High Control & Erosion</a>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Save your result:</strong> Patterns are easier to see in writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Use scripts:</strong> Each result page includes copy-paste language for boundaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Get outside reflection:</strong> If distress feels severe or persistent, consider licensed support.</li>
      </ul>
