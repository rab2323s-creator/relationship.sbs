      <h2>Quick read (30 seconds)</h2>
      <p>
        This profile suggests a relationship where <strong>accountability exists</strong> and <strong>repair is real</strong>.
        Problems don’t disappear—but they can be talked about without punishment, blame-games, or reality confusion.
        That’s not “perfect.” That’s <strong>emotionally safe</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you searched <em>“healthy relationship signs”</em> or <em>“how to know if my relationship is toxic”</em>,
        this result points to protective patterns: honest conversations, fair conflict, and follow-through over time.

      <h2>What a respectful dynamic usually looks like</h2>
      <h3>Green flags you can feel in your nervous system</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Repair happens:</strong> apologies include change, not just words.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundaries are respected:</strong> “no” doesn’t trigger punishment or withdrawal.</li>
        <li><strong>Reality stays clear:</strong> disagreements don’t become reality-wars.</li>
        <li><strong>Both needs matter:</strong> no emotional double standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict resolves:</strong> you leave conversations clearer, not foggy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        The key isn’t “never fighting.” It’s fighting in a way that protects dignity and trust.

      <h2>How to keep this dynamic strong</h2>
      <h3>Healthy patterns still need maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        Even good relationships drift under stress. The advantage you have is a structure that can handle honesty.
        If you want to protect what’s working, focus on the skills that predict long-term security:
        <strong>clear requests</strong>, <strong>fair fighting rules</strong>, and <strong>consistent follow-through</strong>.

    <section class="card prose" id="scripts">
      <h2>Copy-paste scripts (healthy, clear, non-defensive)</h2>
      <h3>Use these to keep repair fast and respectful</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear request:</strong> “When X happens, I feel Y. Could we try Z next time?”</li>
        <li><strong>Repair after conflict:</strong> “I care about us. What’s one thing we can do differently next time?”</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary without drama:</strong> “I’m not available for disrespect. I’ll return when we can talk calmly.”</li>
        <li><strong>Check-in:</strong> “Are we okay? Anything we should clear up before it builds?”</li>
        <li><strong>Stress reframe:</strong> “It’s us vs. the problem, not you vs. me.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Tip: Healthy conflict gets shorter over time because repair is practiced—not improvised.
