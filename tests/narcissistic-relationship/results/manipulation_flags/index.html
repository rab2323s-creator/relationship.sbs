      <h2>Quick read (30 seconds)</h2>
      <p>
        This profile suggests repeated moments where the conversation stops being about the issue—and starts being about
        <strong>controlling the frame</strong>: your tone becomes the topic, your feelings become “too much,” and your reality becomes negotiable.
        You might walk away thinking: <strong>“Did I imagine it?”</strong> or <strong>“How did this become my fault?”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        People often search <em>“am I being gaslighted?”</em>, <em>“blame shifting in relationships”</em>, or <em>“emotional manipulation signs”</em>
        when they keep feeling confused after conflict. This page helps you name the pattern—without turning a label into an accusation.

    <section class="card prose" id="what-it-can-look-like">
      <h2>What manipulation flags can look like</h2>
      <h3>Small moments, repeated, become a system</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Blame shifting:</strong> you raise a concern, and suddenly you’re apologizing for their reaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Reality confusion:</strong> denial, rewriting, or minimizing until you doubt your memory (gaslighting-like pattern).</li>
        <li><strong>Tone policing:</strong> the “wrong tone” becomes the reason your point doesn’t matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Selective accountability:</strong> they admit just enough to end the conflict, but behavior doesn’t change.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional pressure:</strong> guilt, fear, or pity is used to steer your choices and silence your needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        One messy argument isn’t the issue. A repeatable pattern that leaves you self-doubting is.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card prose" id="why-it-hits">
      <h2>Why this is so draining</h2>
      <h3>Because the conversation never lands</h3>
      <p>
        Healthy conflict ends with clearer reality: what happened, what mattered, and what changes next.
        Manipulation ends with <strong>fog</strong>: you feel guilty, confused, and responsible—while the original issue disappears.
        Over time, you may stop bringing things up because it’s easier than being “put on trial.”
      </p>

    <section class="card prose" id="scripts">
      <h2>Copy-paste scripts (short boundaries, hard to twist)</h2>
      <h3>Say less. Track more.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When they shift blame:</strong> “I’m open to feedback later. Right now I’m addressing the behavior that hurt me.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they deny what happened:</strong> “I’m not debating the past. I’m naming the impact and what I need next.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they tone-police:</strong> “My tone isn’t the topic. The behavior is.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they guilt you:</strong> “I understand you’re upset. My boundary still stands.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they demand instant resolution:</strong> “I’m taking a break. We can revisit this when it stays respectful.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Tip: Long explanations become “material” to argue with. A boundary is a sentence, not a debate.

    <section class="card prose" id="next-steps">
      <h2>Next steps (simple, repeatable)</h2>
      <h3>Use a 3-step check for two weeks</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Name one pattern:</strong> blame shifting, denial, minimizing, pressure, or tone policing.</li>
        <li><strong>Set one boundary:</strong> one sentence + one consequence you can follow through on.</li>
        <li><strong>Track follow-through:</strong> change is behavior over time, not apologies in the moment.</li>
      </ol>

        <li>Threats, intimidation, or fear of their reaction when you set boundaries.</li>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What does “Manipulation Flags” mean?</h3>
      <p>
        It means your answers suggested repeated signs of manipulation: blame shifting, emotional pressure, and reality confusion (gaslighting-like patterns) that leave you self-doubting.
        This is educational, not a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h3>Is this a diagnosis of abuse or Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)?</h3>
      <p>
        No. This page explains patterns only. It does not diagnose abuse, NPD, or any condition.
        If you feel unsafe, treat it as a safety concern and consider local support options.
      </p>

      <h3>What should I do if I’m unsure?</h3>
      <p>
        Choose one boundary, watch follow-through for two weeks, and get outside reflection.
        If fear, monitoring, threats, or escalation are present, prioritize safety and support.
      </p>
