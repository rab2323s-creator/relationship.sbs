      <h2>Quick read (30 seconds)</h2>
      <p>
        This profile suggests a relationship cycle where the center of gravity keeps returning to <strong>their needs, their mood, their image</strong>—
        and you pay the cost. You may bring up something real, and end up defending your tone, comforting them, or apologizing just to restore calm.
        Over time, you can start living in a quiet question: <strong>“Why is it always my job to make this okay?”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people search <em>“am I dating a narcissist?”</em> or <em>“narcissistic relationship signs”</em> when they feel stuck in
        <strong>blame shifting</strong>, <strong>low accountability</strong>, and <strong>repair-without-change</strong>.
        This page helps you name the pattern and choose next steps—without turning a label into a weapon.
      </p>

    <section class="card prose" id="cycle">
      <h2>The cycle this result points to</h2>
      <h3>Charm → conflict → blame → your apology → temporary calm → repeat</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Concern becomes a trial:</strong> your point disappears, and the conversation becomes about your “tone” or “timing.”</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability stays thin:</strong> apologies come fast when tension rises, but behavior doesn’t change later.</li>
        <li><strong>Image-first repair:</strong> the goal is to look fine again—not to fix the underlying pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Double standards:</strong> their feelings are urgent; yours are “too much.”</li>
        <li><strong>Blame shifting:</strong> you end up responsible for their reaction, not just your actions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        One selfish moment isn’t this profile. A repeated system that keeps you small is.

    </section>

    <section class="card prose" id="how-it-feels">
      <h2>How this usually feels on the inside</h2>
      <h3>The most common signal is not anger—it’s self-doubt</h3>
      <p>
        You may notice that you’ve become careful: you rehearse messages, you explain more than necessary, you anticipate reactions.
        You might even start collecting “evidence” in your head because you don’t trust the conversation to stay honest.
        If that sounds familiar, it’s not weakness—it's your mind trying to restore reality in a reality-warping loop.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card prose" id="scripts">
      <h2>Copy-paste scripts (boundaries that stay clean)</h2>
      <h3>Short sentences protect your reality</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When they blame-shift:</strong> “I’m discussing the behavior. I’m not taking responsibility for your reaction.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they tone-police:</strong> “We can talk about tone after we address the issue I raised.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they minimize:</strong> “You don’t have to agree with my feelings to respect them.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they promise change without steps:</strong> “What will you do differently this week? I need one concrete action.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they loop the conversation:</strong> “We’re repeating. I’m pausing now and we can revisit when it stays respectful.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        Tip: In blame-shifting dynamics, long explanations become “material” to twist. A boundary is a sentence, not a debate.
      </p>

    <section class="card prose" id="next-steps">
      <h2>Next steps (practical, not dramatic)</h2>
      <h3>Try a 3-step check for two weeks</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Name one pattern:</strong> blame shifting, denial, minimizing, or repair-without-change.</li>
        <li><strong>Set one boundary:</strong> one sentence + one consequence you can follow through on.</li>
        <li><strong>Track follow-through:</strong> steady behavior change matters more than apologies in the moment.</li>

      <h3>When to treat this as a safety issue</h3>
