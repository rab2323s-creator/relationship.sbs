      <h2>Quick read (30 seconds)</h2>
      <p>
        This profile suggests a repeated dynamic where the relationship feels “stable” only when <strong>you shrink</strong>:
        you explain less, ask less, and protect their mood more than your own reality. It often shows up as
        <strong>punishment for boundaries</strong>, <strong>monitoring</strong>, <strong>fear of conflict</strong>, and
        “repair” that restores calm without restoring respect.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you searched <em>“am I being controlled in my relationship?”</em> or <em>“coercive control signs”</em>,
        this page is meant to turn that fear into a clearer map—without turning a mental-health label into a weapon.

    <section class="card prose" id="what-it-can-look-like">
      <h2>What this pattern often looks like</h2>
      <h3>Not always loud. Often systematic.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Boundaries trigger punishment:</strong> silence, anger, guilt, threats, or withdrawal when you say “no.”</li>
        <li><strong>Your choices narrow over time:</strong> less freedom, fewer friends, fewer “acceptable” opinions.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring / policing:</strong> your phone, location, spending, clothes, tone, schedule, or social media.</li>
        <li><strong>Reality management:</strong> denial, minimizing, rewriting events until you doubt yourself (gaslighting-like patterns).</li>
        <li><strong>Repair without repair:</strong> apologies reset the fight, but nothing changes in the structure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        One argument doesn’t define a relationship. A repeated pattern that shrinks your life does.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card prose" id="why-it-feels-hard">
      <h2>Why this feels so confusing</h2>
      <h3>Because the “peace” is conditional</h3>
      <p>
        In high-control dynamics, peace often comes at a price: you become skilled at predicting reactions,
        avoiding topics, and managing emotions that aren’t yours to manage.
        Over time, this can create a painful loop: <strong>fear → appeasement → temporary calm → more control</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you recognize this, the goal isn’t to win the next argument. It’s to protect your reality and options.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card prose" id="scripts">
      <h2>Copy-paste scripts (clear, calm, boundaried)</h2>
      <h3>Use the shortest sentence that tells the truth</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>When they punish boundaries:</strong> “I’m available to talk when we can be respectful. I’m not negotiating under pressure.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they demand access/monitoring:</strong> “I’m not comfortable with surveillance. Trust requires respect for privacy.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they rewrite reality:</strong> “I’m not debating what happened. I’m describing the impact and what I need next.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they isolate you:</strong> “My support system stays. Healthy relationships don’t require me to disappear.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        Tip: In control dynamics, long explanations become “material” to argue with. Short boundaries are harder to twist.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card prose" id="next-steps">
      <h2>Next steps (practical, not dramatic)</h2>
      <h3>Try a 3-step check for two weeks</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Name one behavior:</strong> Pick one pattern you can observe (monitoring, threats, denial, punishment).</li>
        <li><strong>Set one boundary:</strong> One sentence. One consequence. Follow through calmly.</li>
        <li><strong>Track behavior change:</strong> Respect grows with consistency, not intensity.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Safety</h2>
      <h3>When to treat this as a safety issue</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Threats, intimidation, or fear of their reaction when you set boundaries.</li>
        <li>Monitoring your phone, finances, location, or isolating you from friends/family.</li>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What does “High Control &amp; Erosion” mean?</h3>
      <p>
        It means your answers suggested a recurring control pattern: boundaries trigger punishment, your reality is managed or questioned,
        and your choices get narrowed over time. This is educational, not a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h3>Is this a diagnosis of abuse or Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)?</h3>
      <p>
        No. This page explains patterns only. It does not diagnose abuse, NPD, or any condition.
        If you feel unsafe, treat it as a safety concern and consider local support options.
      </p>

      <h3>What should I do if I’m unsure?</h3>
      <p>
        Choose one boundary, watch follow-through for two weeks, and get outside reflection.
        If fear, monitoring, threats, or escalation are present, prioritize safety and support.
