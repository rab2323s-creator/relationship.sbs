      <h2>Quick Answer: “Am I in a Narcissistic Relationship?”</h2>
      <p>
        You may be in a narcissistic relationship dynamic if conflict repeatedly ends with <strong>your reality being questioned</strong>,
        <strong>your needs being minimized</strong>, and <strong>you apologizing to restore calm</strong>—while the other person avoids
        consistent accountability or lasting change.
      </p>

      <h3>Most common patterns people search for</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaslighting:</strong> your memory/feelings get repeatedly questioned or rewritten.</li>
        <li><strong>Blame shifting:</strong> your concern becomes a debate about your “tone,” not their behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> boundaries trigger punishment (coldness, anger, threats, withdrawal).</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional double standards:</strong> their feelings matter more; yours are “too much.”</li>
        <li><strong>Repair without change:</strong> apologies reset the cycle but behavior stays the same.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card prose" id="method">
      <h2>How This Test Works (Method + What It’s Designed to Catch)</h2>
      <h3>Patterns over labels</h3>
      <p>
        This page is built to help you spot <strong>repeatable relationship patterns</strong> that erode self-trust—without turning mental-health terms into accusations.
        The questions focus on the behaviors people most commonly describe when searching:
        <em>“gaslighting,” “love bombing,” “blame shifting,” “coercive control,”</em> and <em>“emotional manipulation.”</em>
      </p>

      <h3>What the score reflects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> do they own impact and make repairs?</li>
        <li><strong>Reality safety:</strong> do you feel clear after conflict, or foggy and self-doubting?</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary response:</strong> is “no” respected—or punished?</li>
        <li><strong>Repair pattern:</strong> do promises convert into behavior change over time?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What this test does NOT do</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No diagnosis (not NPD, not therapy, not medical advice).</li>
        <li>No certainty claims—only pattern signals and practical next steps.</li>
        <li>No graphic content; ad-safe, educational language.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How scoring works</h2>
      <p>
        This test assigns points based on patterns across 15 scenarios (accountability, blame shifting, reality confusion,
        control, and repair). Your total score maps to one of five profiles for clarity—not certainty.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower range:</strong> healthier repair and respect tend to show up consistently.</li>
        <li><strong>Mid range:</strong> mixed signals—some accountability, but repeated friction or invalidation.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher range:</strong> repeated manipulation/control patterns and low follow-through on change.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Is it narcissism or stress?</strong> Under stress, people slip once. In a pattern, accountability stays missing.</li>

        <li><strong>Is my partner emotionally manipulative?</strong> Do they use guilt, fear, or confusion to steer your choices?</li>
        <li><strong>Is this coercive control?</strong> Do boundaries trigger punishment, monitoring, or isolation from support?</li>
        <li><strong>Do they have double standards?</strong> Are your needs “too much” while theirs are treated as urgent?</li>

        <li><strong>Do arguments feel like a maze?</strong> Does the topic switch until you forget your original point?</li>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Name one observable behavior</strong> (not a label): “When you deny what you said yesterday…”</li>
        <li><strong>Set one boundary</strong>: “If this turns into insults or denial, I’m pausing the conversation.”</li>
        <li><strong>Track follow-through</strong> for 2–4 weeks: consistent behavior change matters more than apologies.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>When they blame-shift:</strong> “I can discuss my tone later. Right now I’m addressing the behavior that hurt me.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they minimize:</strong> “You don’t have to agree with my feelings to respect them.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they rewrite reality:</strong> “I’m not debating what happened. I’m explaining the impact and what I need next.”</li>
        <li><strong>When they punish boundaries:</strong> “Distance is your choice. I’ll reconnect when we can speak respectfully.”</li>

    <!-- FAQ: on-page readable + snippet-friendly -->
    <section class="card prose" id="faq">
      <h2>Narcissistic Relationship FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What is a narcissistic relationship?</h3>
      <p>
        A narcissistic relationship is a repeated dynamic where one person centers image, power, or self-interest and uses patterns like blame shifting,
        minimization, or control. The other person often ends up self-doubting, over-explaining, and apologizing to keep peace.
      </p>

      <h3>What is gaslighting in a relationship?</h3>
      <p>
        Gaslighting is repeated reality distortion—denying, rewriting, or minimizing events until you doubt your memory, judgment, or feelings.
        The key is repetition over time, not one disagreement.
      </p>

      <h3>Is this a narcissistic abuse test?</h3>
      <p>
        This is an educational self-reflection quiz about patterns. It does not diagnose abuse or any disorder.
        If you feel emotionally unsafe or severely distressed, consider licensed professional support and trusted allies.
      </p>

      <h3>Can someone with narcissistic traits change?</h3>
      <p>
        Change is possible when a person takes accountability and shows consistent behavior change over time.
        Intensity in the moment is not the same as follow-through across weeks.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <h3>Educational use only</h3>
