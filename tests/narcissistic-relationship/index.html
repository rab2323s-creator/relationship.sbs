      <h1>Are You in a Narcissistic Relationship?</h1>

      <h2>Read This First (It Might Hit Too Close)</h2>
      <h3>If you keep apologizing just to make peace… pay attention.</h3>
      <p>
        You’re not here because you love drama. You’re here because something feels off:
        the emotional whiplash, the blame that somehow lands on you, the way your feelings get edited down to “acceptable.”
        You might even be asking yourself: <strong>“Am I the problem?”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This <strong>Narcissistic Relationship Test</strong> is built around modern relationship moments:
        tone shifts, silent distance, image-first behavior, “I never said that,” and apology cycles that don’t change anything.
        It’s designed to be <strong>high-retention</strong> and <strong>ad-safe</strong> (no diagnosis, no medical claims)—
        just a clear look at patterns that erode your self-trust.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Narcissistic Relationship Patterns Feel So Confusing</h2>
      <h3>Because the relationship rewards you for shrinking.</h3>
      <p>
        In unhealthy dynamics, the “easiest” way to restore calm is to become smaller: explain less, ask less, need less.
        Over time, you can start managing their mood more than your own life.
      </p>

      <h3>Because accountability becomes a maze.</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of “I hear you,” you get debates, technicalities, and reversals:
        you bring up a hurt, and somehow you end up comforting them.
      </p>

      <h3>Most people don’t realize this…</h3>
      <p>
        The red flag isn’t one selfish moment. It’s the <em>repeatable cycle</em>:
        charm → dismissal → blame → your apology → temporary peace → same pattern again.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Test Measures (And What It Doesn’t)</h2>
      <h3>What it measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Accountability vs. blame-shifting</li>
        <li>Repair behavior (real change vs. temporary calm)</li>
        <li>Emotional double standards (their feelings matter more)</li>
        <li>Control patterns (you walking on eggshells)</li>
        <li>Reality confusion (minimizing, rewriting, “you’re too sensitive”)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What it doesn’t</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No diagnosis (not NPD, not therapy)</li>
        <li>No promises of outcomes</li>
        <li>No graphic content; this is an educational pattern-based quiz (ad-safe)</li>
      </ul>

        <li>They’re charming in public, cold in private.</li>

      <h2>Your Results</h2>
      <h3>Five profiles (your engine calculates automatically)</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll land in one of five profiles: Respectful Dynamic, Self-Centered Friction, Manipulation Flags,
        Narcissistic Pattern Likely, or High Control & Erosion.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Share tip:</strong> If your result feels painfully accurate, save it. Patterns are easier to see in writing.</p>

      <h2>What To Do Next</h2>
      <h3>The goal isn’t to “win” an argument. It’s to protect your reality.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Name one concrete behavior (not a label), then make one clear request.</li>
        <li>Watch follow-through over time—not apologies in the moment.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Narcissistic Relationship FAQ (SEO)</h2>

      <h3>What is a narcissistic relationship?</h3>
      <p>
        It’s a dynamic where one person’s needs, image, and control repeatedly come first, while the other person feels increasingly unsure,
        smaller, or responsible for keeping peace. The key is repetition: patterns that consistently erase your feelings and reality.
      </p>

      <h3>What is gaslighting in a relationship?</h3>
      <p>
        Gaslighting is a pattern where your reality is repeatedly questioned or rewritten until you doubt your memory or judgment.
        Look for repeated phrases like “that never happened,” “you’re too sensitive,” and constant reframing that leaves you confused.
      </p>

      <h3>Is this Narcissistic Relationship Test a diagnosis?</h3>
      <p>
        No. This is an educational self-reflection quiz. It does not diagnose Narcissistic Personality Disorder or any mental health condition.
        If you feel persistently distressed, consider speaking with a licensed professional.
      </p>
