      <h2>Love language quiz: what it’s for</h2>
      <p>The idea of <strong>love languages</strong> is simple: people often <em>give</em> and <em>receive</em> care in different ways. This love language quiz helps you name what lands for you—so you stop guessing and start asking clearly.</p>

      <h3>Why love languages matter in real relationships</h3>
      <p>Many couples fight about “effort” when the real issue is “translation.” One person is doing acts of service, the other wants quality time. Nobody is wrong—communication is missing.</p>

      <h3>How to use your result today</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick one concrete ask</strong> (not a personality critique): “Can we do a 20-minute walk without phones?”</li>
        <li><strong>Notice your default giving style</strong>: do you give what you want, or what they want?</li>
        <li><strong>Make it measurable</strong>: vague needs create disappointment; specific requests create closeness.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Common mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Using love languages as labels to avoid deeper issues (boundaries, trust, respect).</li>
        <li>Demanding your language without learning theirs.</li>
        <li>Thinking one grand gesture replaces daily consistency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Love languages FAQ</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <details><summary>Can I have more than one love language?</summary><p>Yes. Most people have a primary and a secondary preference.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Do love languages change over time?</summary><p>They can—especially during stress, parenting, long-distance, or after conflict.</p></details>
        <details><summary>Is this scientifically proven?</summary><p>Consider it a communication framework. It’s useful when it improves clarity and care.</p></details>
        <details><summary>What if my partner refuses this idea?</summary><p>Skip the label and talk behavior: “What makes you feel loved—time, help, words, touch, gifts?”</p></details>

  <h2>What is a love language?</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>love language</strong> is the primary way you prefer to <em>give</em> and <em>receive</em> affection.
    Many relationship problems aren’t about a lack of love — but a mismatch in how love is expressed.
    That’s why “I love you” can feel empty to one partner and deeply meaningful to another.
  </p>

  <h2>Love language types explained</h2>
  <div class="grid2">
    <div class="mini"><h3>Words of Affirmation</h3><p>Praise, reassurance, validation, and verbal appreciation.</p></div>
    <div class="mini"><h3>Quality Time</h3><p>Attention, presence, undistracted time, shared activities.</p></div>
    <div class="mini"><h3>Acts of Service</h3><p>Help, reliability, doing tasks that reduce stress.</p></div>
    <div class="mini"><h3>Physical Touch</h3><p>Hugs, cuddling, hand-holding, physical closeness.</p></div>
    <div class="mini"><h3>Receiving Gifts</h3><p>Thoughtful tokens that signal “I remembered you”.</p></div>
  </div>

  <h2>How to use your results in real relationships</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Don’t demand mind-reading:</strong> tell your partner what makes you feel loved.</li>
    <li><strong>Translate effort:</strong> their love may be real but expressed differently.</li>
    <li><strong>Create a weekly ritual:</strong> one action that matches your partner’s top love language.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>FAQ — Love language test</h2>
  <details><summary>Can I have more than one love language?</summary><p>Yes. Most people have 2 dominant love languages. Context and stress also change what you need most.</p></details>
  <details><summary>What if my partner has a different love language?</summary><p>This is normal. The solution is “bilingual love”: you both practice the other’s language intentionally.</p></details>
  <details><summary>Is physical touch only about sex?</summary><p>No. For many people it’s about comfort, safety, warmth, and connection — not only intimacy.</p></details>
  <details><summary>How do I ask for my love language without sounding needy?</summary><p>Use a positive request: “It means a lot when you ___.” Then suggest a small, repeatable action.</p></details>
