  <h2>Love language quiz (deep profile)</h2>
  <p>This isn’t a fluffy “pick a label” love language test. It measures <strong>receiving</strong> vs <strong>giving</strong> and what you crave <strong>under stress</strong>—because that’s where couples misread each other and start fighting about “effort.”</p>

  <h3>What this test reveals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your <strong>top 2 receiving</strong> love languages (what lands for you).</li>
    <li>Your <strong>top 2 giving</strong> patterns (how you naturally show care).</li>
    <li>Your <strong>stress language</strong> (what you need right after conflict).</li>
  </ul>

<details><summary>How do I show love to someone with touch?</summary><p>Affection outside sex: hugs, hand-holding, closeness with consent.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I show love to someone with gifts?</summary><p>Small thoughtful items; remember preferences and moments.</p></details>

<details><summary>Why do I feel disconnected when we’re together?</summary><p>If your language is quality time, distraction can feel like emotional absence.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do I feel unseen when they don’t help?</summary><p>If your language is service, help signals care and partnership.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do I feel cold when there’s no touch?</summary><p>If your language is touch, affection regulates closeness and safety.</p></details>
<details><summary>Why do I need reassurance so often?</summary><p>If words land for you, silence can trigger doubt—even if love is real.</p></details>
<details><summary>Do love languages apply to friendships?</summary><p>Yes. The same signals can matter with friends and family.</p></details>
<details><summary>Do love languages apply to long distance?</summary><p>Yes. You just translate: time becomes calls, service becomes planning, gifts become tokens.</p></details>
<details><summary>What’s a good weekly ritual for each language?</summary><p>Words: daily appreciation. Time: phones-down hour. Service: one task. Touch: hello/goodbye. Gifts: small token.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I talk about this without labels?</summary><p>Ask the behavioral version: ‘What makes you feel cared for?’ and share your own.</p></details>
<details><summary>What if my partner refuses my requests?</summary><p>Notice patterns: inability to repair and lack of effort are bigger than love language differences.</p></details>
<details><summary>What’s the fastest improvement?</summary><p>One small repeatable behavior aligned with your partner’s top language.</p></details>
