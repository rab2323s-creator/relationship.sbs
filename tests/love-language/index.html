  <h2>Love Language Test (Deep Profile)</h2>
  <p>This isn’t a fluffy “pick a label” love language test. It measures <strong>receiving</strong> vs <strong>giving</strong> and what you crave <strong>under stress</strong>—because that’s where couples misread each other and start fighting about “effort.”</p>

  <h3>What this test reveals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Your <strong>top 2 receiving</strong> love languages (what lands for you).</li>
    <li>Your <strong>top 2 giving</strong> patterns (how you naturally show care).</li>
    <li>Your <strong>stress language</strong> (what you need right after conflict).</li>
  </ul>
