      <h2>Love Language Test (Deep Profile)</h2>
      <p>
        This isn’t a fluffy “pick a label” love language test. It measures <strong>receiving</strong> vs <strong>giving</strong>
        and what you crave <strong>under stress</strong>—because that’s where couples misread effort and start fighting about “you don’t care.”
      </p>

      <h3>What this test reveals (in plain English)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your top 2 receiving</strong> love languages (what actually makes you feel cared for).</li>
        <li><strong>Your top 2 giving</strong> patterns (how you naturally show love).</li>
        <li><strong>Your stress language</strong> (what you need right after conflict to reconnect).</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Non-duplicate scenario prompts (not the same as JS questions) -->
      <h3>Real-life moments this quiz helps you decode</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        These are <strong>example prompts</strong> written differently than the test questions, so Google can understand the page
        without repeating the quiz wording.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“They’re trying… but it doesn’t land.”</strong> Is the issue effort—or translation?</li>
        <li><strong>After a fight:</strong> do you need words, time, help, touch, or a meaningful gesture to feel close again?</li>
        <li><strong>Daily life:</strong> do you feel loved by appreciation, presence, reliability, affection, or thoughtfulness?</li>
        <li><strong>Mismatched love styles:</strong> are you giving what you would want… instead of what your partner actually needs?</li>
        <li><strong>Neglect triggers:</strong> what hurts most—cold words, distraction, broken promises, lack of touch, or thoughtlessness?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Next step (most people need this after results)</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Many relationships don’t fail because love is missing—they fail because <strong>repair</strong> is missing.
        If love languages explain the “translation,” the next tests explain the “conflict loop” and the “availability gap.”
