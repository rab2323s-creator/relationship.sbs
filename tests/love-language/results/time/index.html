      <h2>What this result usually means</h2>
      <p>
        When Quality Time is your top love language, you don’t just want time near someone—you want time <strong>with</strong> them.
        You feel cared for when your partner is mentally present: listening, responding, noticing, sharing.
        For you, love looks like <strong>“I’m here, with you, fully.”</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>What counts (and what doesn’t)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counts:</strong> phones-down conversation, shared meals, walks, a planned hour together, eye contact, real listening.</li>
        <li><strong>Doesn’t count:</strong> being in the same room while scrolling, half-listening, “quality time” that’s rushed or distracted.</li>
        <li><strong>The real signal:</strong> attention—because attention says “you matter.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What hurts (common misreads)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multitasking:</strong> can feel like emotional absence, even if they didn’t mean it that way.</li>
        <li><strong>Last-minute cancellations:</strong> can feel like you’re not a priority.</li>
        <li><strong>Being “together” but not connecting:</strong> can feel lonelier than being apart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to ask without sounding needy (copy-paste)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Ask for a ritual. Keep it small, scheduled, and repeatable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Can we do <strong>20 minutes phones-down</strong> tonight? I feel really close when we’re fully present.”</li>
        <li>“This week, could we plan <strong>one hour</strong> that’s just us—no screens, no errands?”</li>
        <li>“When you’re busy, a <strong>10-minute check-in</strong> helps me feel connected.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If you’re dating someone with this love language</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make it predictable:</strong> one recurring time block beats “we should hang out sometime.”</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce distraction:</strong> put your phone away first—then talk.</li>
        <li><strong>Use micro-connection:</strong> a quick walk, coffee, or debrief ritual can keep them feeling close.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Simple rituals that work (choose one)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily:</strong> 10 minutes check-in (one win, one stress, one need).</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> one phones-down hour + one shared activity (walk, meal, show with discussion).</li>
        <li><strong>After conflict:</strong> “Are we okay?” gets answered with scheduled reconnection time, not vague reassurance.</li>
      </ul>
