      <h1 id="resultTitle">Your love language: Receiving Gifts</h1>
      <p class="muted"><strong>Short version:</strong> it’s not price—it’s <em>“you were in my mind.”</em></p>

      <div class="row">
        <a class="btn" href="/tests/love-language/#quizRoot">Take the full test (60 seconds)</a>

      <h2>What this result usually means</h2>
      <p>
        When Receiving Gifts is your top love language, a thoughtful item feels like proof of attention.
        The gift itself isn’t the point—the <strong>meaning</strong> is: “I noticed you. I remembered you. I planned for you.”
      </p>

      <h2>What counts (and what doesn’t)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counts:</strong> small surprises, favorite snack, a note saved, something that matches your taste, a souvenir with a story.</li>
        <li><strong>Doesn’t count:</strong> expensive purchases used to skip effort, random items with no thought, gifts after neglect with no repair.</li>
        <li><strong>The real signal:</strong> consistency + remembering, not “big moments.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What hurts (common misreads)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Forgotten dates:</strong> can feel like “I’m not important.”</li>
        <li><strong>Last-minute gifts:</strong> can feel like obligation, not care.</li>
        <li><strong>“You’re materialistic” comments:</strong> can feel like your needs are being dismissed instead of understood.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to ask without sounding needy (copy-paste)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Make it small, specific, and repeatable. No guilt. No tests.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Little surprises mean a lot to me—could you bring me my favorite snack sometimes?”</li>
        <li>“When you remember small details, I feel really loved. Even a note or tiny thing makes a difference.”</li>
        <li>“For my birthday, I’d love something with meaning—doesn’t have to be expensive, just thoughtful.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If you’re dating someone with this love language</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep a tiny list:</strong> favorite snack, drink, flower, color, store, hobby.</li>
        <li><strong>Use “micro gifts”:</strong> once a week or every two weeks beats one grand gesture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a sentence:</strong> “I saw this and thought of you.” That sentence is the love language.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Not sure this is your top result?</h2>
