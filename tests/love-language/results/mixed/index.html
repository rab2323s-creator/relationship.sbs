      <h1 id="resultTitle">Your result: Mixed (your top two love languages are close)</h1>
      <p class="muted"><strong>Short version:</strong> you’re not “hard to love.” You’re multi-signal. Two things land—and timing decides which one you need most.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <a class="btn" href="/tests/love-language/#quizRoot">Take the full test (60 seconds)</a>
        <a class="btn secondary" href="/tests/love-language/results/">See all love language results</a>

      <h2>What “mixed” usually means</h2>
      <p>
        A mixed result doesn’t mean you don’t know what you want. It usually means you have <strong>two equally strong ways</strong>
        of feeling cared for—often one is emotional (words/time/touch) and one is practical (service/gifts).
        In calm seasons you may lean one way; under stress you may lean the other.
      </p>

      <h2>How to interpret your top two (the simple rule)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Language #1:</strong> what makes you feel loved in ordinary daily life.</li>
        <li><strong>Language #2:</strong> what makes you feel loved when you’re tired, stressed, or emotionally raw.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What helps relationships with mixed results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stop “either/or” thinking:</strong> you don’t need a perfect partner—just repeatable signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Use two small rituals:</strong> one from each language, weekly.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it measurable:</strong> avoid vague requests like “be more loving.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to ask without sounding needy (copy-paste)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Pick one sentence. Keep it kind. Keep it repeatable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“I’m mixed: two things land for me. A little <strong>___</strong> and a little <strong>___</strong> each week makes me feel really loved.”</li>
        <li>“When I’m stressed, I need more <strong>___</strong>. When things are normal, I feel loved with <strong>___</strong>.”</li>
        <li>“Can we try a simple ritual? One phones-down hour + one small practical help thing each week.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Weekly rituals (simple examples)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Words + Time:</strong> one appreciation text daily + one phones-down hour weekly.</li>
        <li><strong>Time + Touch:</strong> a walk + hello/goodbye hugs (consistent).</li>
        <li><strong>Words + Service:</strong> specific praise + one task taken off your plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Gifts + Time:</strong> small thoughtful token + planned date hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Service + Touch:</strong> follow-through + affectionate touch outside sex.</li>
      </ul>
