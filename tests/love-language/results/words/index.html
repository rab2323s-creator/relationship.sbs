      <h2>What this result usually means</h2>
      <p>
        When Words of Affirmation is your top love language, you feel loved when care is <strong>named</strong>.
        Not vague compliments—specific words that show you were seen:
        what your partner values about you, what they appreciate, and what they choose.
      </p>

      <h2>What counts (and what doesn’t)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counts:</strong> “I appreciate how you handled that,” “I’m proud of you,” “I choose you,” “Thank you for ___.”</li>
        <li><strong>Doesn’t count:</strong> generic “nice” compliments, teasing that lands as criticism, silence during stress.</li>
        <li><strong>The real signal:</strong> clarity—because clarity reduces doubt.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What hurts (common misreads)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Silence:</strong> can feel like disinterest—even if they’re just distracted.</li>
        <li><strong>Sarcasm / “jokes”:</strong> can land as rejection when you’re already unsure.</li>
        <li><strong>Praise only after you beg:</strong> can feel performative instead of heartfelt.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to ask without sounding needy (copy-paste)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Ask for one sentence. Make it repeatable. Make it positive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“It helps me a lot when you tell me what you appreciate about me—one sentence a day is enough.”</li>
        <li>“When you’re busy, can you still send a quick ‘thinking of you’? It keeps me feeling connected.”</li>
        <li>“After conflict, I reconnect faster when you say ‘I’m here, we’re okay, we’ll fix this.’”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If you’re dating someone with this love language</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> name impact (“I felt supported when you ___”).</li>
        <li><strong>Reassure during stress:</strong> don’t leave them guessing.</li>
        <li><strong>Use micro-affirmations:</strong> short messages consistently beat one big speech.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Simple rituals that work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily:</strong> one appreciation sentence (specific, not generic).</li>
        <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> “What I loved about us this week” (2 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>After conflict:</strong> acknowledge impact + reassurance + one next step.</li>
      </ul>
