        If you searched <strong>what’s my love language test</strong> (or <strong>whats my love language test</strong>),
        you’re usually not looking for a label—you’re looking for a reason things don’t land.
        This page explains each love language result in human terms: <strong>what counts</strong>, <strong>what hurts</strong>,
        and <strong>how to ask</strong> without sounding needy.

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Name the signal:</strong> “What lands for me is ___.”</li>
        <li><strong>Make it measurable:</strong> one small repeatable behavior (not “be more loving”).</li>
        <li><strong>Translate effort:</strong> ask for what lands, and learn what lands for them too.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>If this is really a conflict problem, take this next</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Love languages solve “translation.” But many couples get stuck in <strong>repair</strong> (how you recover after tension).
        These follow-ups usually unlock the fastest improvement.
