      <h2>What this result usually means</h2>
      <p>
        When Acts of Service is your top love language, effort isn’t just “nice”—it’s the signal that you matter.
        You feel cared for when someone <strong>reduces your load</strong>, anticipates needs, and follows through without being reminded.
      </p>

      <h2>What counts (and what doesn’t)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counts:</strong> doing a task you’re carrying, planning logistics, showing up on time, consistency, follow-through.</li>
        <li><strong>Doesn’t count:</strong> big promises with no action, “I meant to” apologies, help offered once then dropped.</li>
        <li><strong>The real signal:</strong> reliability—because reliability creates safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What hurts (common misreads)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Being left to carry everything:</strong> can feel like “I’m alone in this.”</li>
        <li><strong>Weaponized incompetence:</strong> “I did it wrong so you’ll stop asking” erodes trust fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Words without follow-through:</strong> can feel empty—even if love is real.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to ask without sounding needy (copy-paste)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Make it specific, small, and repeatable. Ask for a behavior, not a personality change.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“It would mean a lot if you handled <strong>___</strong> on <strong>___</strong>. When you do that, I feel really supported.”</li>
        <li>“Can we pick one task each that we always own? Consistency helps me feel secure.”</li>
        <li>“When you follow through on small things, I feel loved. Can we try one weekly ‘help ritual’?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If you’re dating someone with this love language</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do one thing you can repeat:</strong> weekly groceries, laundry, planning, admin—anything consistent.</li>
        <li><strong>Close the loop:</strong> “I did it” is a love language sentence.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t wait to be asked:</strong> initiative is the romance here.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Not sure this is your top result?</h2>
