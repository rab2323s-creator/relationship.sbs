      <h2>What this result usually means</h2>
      <p>
        When Physical Touch is your top love language, affection helps you feel anchored and secure.
        Touch isn’t about intensity—it’s about <strong>reassurance</strong>.
        A hand on your back, a hug hello, or sitting close can calm anxiety faster than words.
      </p>

      <h2>What counts (and what doesn’t)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Counts:</strong> hugs, hand-holding, cuddling, leaning close, gentle touch in everyday moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Doesn’t count:</strong> touch only during sex, affection used to avoid conversation, unwanted or rushed contact.</li>
        <li><strong>The real signal:</strong> safe, consistent, consensual closeness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What hurts (common misreads)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Withholding touch:</strong> can feel like emotional distance or rejection.</li>
        <li><strong>Touch only when initiating sex:</strong> can feel transactional instead of loving.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring consent or mood:</strong> can flip comfort into stress.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to ask without sounding needy (copy-paste)</h2>
      <p class="muted">Ask for clear, non-sexual gestures first. Keep it simple and repeatable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“A hug when we see each other helps me feel really connected.”</li>
        <li>“Can we sit close when we watch something? That makes me feel safe.”</li>
        <li>“When I’m stressed, gentle touch helps me calm down more than talking.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If you’re dating someone with this love language</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Offer everyday affection:</strong> not just during sex or conflict repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for consent:</strong> “Is this okay?” builds trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Use touch to reassure:</strong> especially during hard conversations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Simple rituals that work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hello / goodbye hugs:</strong> every time, even briefly.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress reset:</strong> 30 seconds of holding hands after tough moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Connection time:</strong> sit close during one shared activity each day.</li>
      </ul>
