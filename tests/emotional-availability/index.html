      <h1>Emotional Availability Test — Is Your Partner Emotionally There?</h1>

      <h2>Read This First (It Might Hit Too Close)</h2>
      <h3>You can be “in a relationship” and still feel emotionally alone.</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional availability is not romance. It’s not constant texting. It’s the quiet feeling that your emotions are welcome here.
        The moment you start editing yourself—making your feelings smaller, softer, “easier”—something important is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        This test is built for modern love: tone shifts, delayed replies, vague plans, repair that never arrives, and the strange feeling
        of being close to someone who still feels far. It’s designed to be <strong>painfully accurate</strong> while staying
        <strong>Google Ads / AdSense safe</strong>: no diagnosis, no medical claims, no promises—just clarity you can act on.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Emotional Availability Matters More Than “Chemistry”</h2>
      <h3>Because your nervous system can’t relax around uncertainty forever.</h3>
      <p>
        When someone is emotionally available, you don’t have to chase reassurance. You can name feelings and expect a human response:
        presence, curiosity, repair. When they’re not, you end up negotiating for basics—attention, clarity, kindness.
      </p>

      <h3>Because the real damage is silent: you stop asking.</h3>
      <p>
        Many people don’t leave because of one big event. They drift because emotional support becomes inconsistent, then rare, then “too much to ask.”
      </p>

      <h3>Most people don’t realize this…</h3>
      <p>
        Couples often argue about the surface—texts, tone, plans—when the deeper issue is simple:
        <em>“When I’m vulnerable, I don’t feel met.”</em> This test helps you name which pattern fits.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Test Measures (And What It Doesn’t)</h2>
      <h3>What it measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Emotional presence (listening, empathy, consistency)</li>
        <li>Repair behavior after tension (do you reconnect or avoid?)</li>

        <li>Your dynamic under stress (support, deflection, shutdown)</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h2>Emotional Availability FAQ (SEO)</h2>

      <h3>What is emotional availability in a relationship?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional availability is the ability to be present with feelings—listening, empathizing, and repairing after tension.
        It’s not perfection. It’s consistency: you can be vulnerable and still feel safe and respected.
      </p>

      <h3>How can I tell if my partner is emotionally unavailable?</h3>
      <p>
        Look for repeatable patterns: deflection, minimizing, avoiding repair, vagueness when you ask for clarity, and emotional support
        only when things are easy. One bad week isn’t the story—repetition over time is.
      </p>

      <h3>Is emotional unavailability the same as being busy?</h3>
      <p>
        Not necessarily. Busy people can still be emotionally present in small ways and can repair after tension. Emotional unavailability
        is when emotional connection and repair rarely happen—even when you ask directly.
      </p>

      <h3>Can emotional availability improve?</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes, when both people agree to specific habits: listening-first, weekly check-ins, and repair rules after conflict.
        Improvement looks like consistent follow-through—not a single heartfelt apology.
      </p>

      <h3>Is this Emotional Availability Test a diagnosis?</h3>
      <p>
        No. This is an educational self-reflection quiz. It does not diagnose mental health conditions or guarantee outcomes.
        If distress feels severe or persistent, consider speaking with a licensed professional.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <h3>Educational use only</h3>
      <p>
        This quiz is for self-reflection and educational purposes only. It is not medical advice, diagnosis, or therapy.
        If distress feels severe or persistent, consider speaking with a licensed professional.
