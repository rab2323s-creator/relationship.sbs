        Five result profiles that explain emotional availability, inconsistency, and repair patterns in relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you finished the test, your score maps to one profile below. If you’re still deciding whether to take it,
        this page helps you understand what each result means—without labels or diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2>All 5 Result Profiles (Quick Definitions)</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Read the short summary, then open the full profile page for scripts, signs, and next steps.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="/tests/emotional-availability/results/present_partner/">Present Partner</a></h3>
      <p>
        Emotional support feels consistent. Feelings are acknowledged, communication is clearer, and repair after conflict tends to happen.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="/tests/emotional-availability/results/inconsistent_presence/">Inconsistent Presence</a></h3>
      <p>
        Care exists, but it’s not reliable. Connection may depend on mood, stress, timing, or convenience—creating mixed signals.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="/tests/emotional-availability/results/guarded_unavailable/">Guarded / Unavailable</a></h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intimacy feels limited. Vulnerability is often minimized, deflected, or met with distance—especially in hard conversations.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="/tests/emotional-availability/results/avoid_repair/">Avoids Repair</a></h3>
      <p>
        Tension happens, but reconnection doesn’t. Conflicts end without closure, repair talks are avoided, and issues repeat.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="/tests/emotional-availability/results/emotionally_absent/">Emotionally Absent</a></h3>
      <p>
        Emotional support feels missing. You may feel emotionally alone, unseen, or unsupported—especially during stress and conflict.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use These Results (Without Overthinking)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Look for repetition:</strong> one bad week isn’t the story—patterns over time are.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch repair:</strong> consistent repair matters more than big promises.</li>
        <li><strong>Make one clear request:</strong> ask for presence, a check-in, or a repair conversation—and observe follow-through.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick script (ad-safe)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I don’t need fixing—just presence. Can you listen for 2 minutes and reflect what you heard?”</li>
        <li>“After tension, I need repair. Can we reconnect within 24 hours?”</li>
      </ul>
