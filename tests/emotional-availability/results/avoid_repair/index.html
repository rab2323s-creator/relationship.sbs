      <h1>Avoids Repair</h1>
      <p class="muted">Emotional Availability Test — Result Profile</p>

      <p>
        Your result points to a pattern where <strong>conflict happens, but emotional repair does not</strong>.
        Disagreements may be brushed aside, ignored, or left unresolved. Over time, this creates emotional
        distance—not because of constant fighting, but because reconnection never fully arrives.
      </p>

      <h2>Common signs of avoiding repair</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Conflicts end with silence, distraction, or pretending nothing happened</li>
        <li>Apologies are rare, vague, or focused on “moving on” too quickly</li>
        <li>Emotional topics are postponed indefinitely</li>
        <li>You feel pressure to drop issues to keep the peace</li>
        <li>The same problems repeat without resolution</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why this pattern damages emotional safety</h2>
      <p>
        Repair is how trust is rebuilt. When repair is avoided, your nervous system never fully relaxes.
        Many people respond by suppressing needs, walking on eggshells, or emotionally withdrawing—
        not because they don’t care, but because reconnection feels unreliable.
      </p>

      <h2>What to do next (practical and ad-safe)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name the need:</strong> “I don’t need agreement—I need repair after conflict.”</li>
        <li><strong>Set a timeframe:</strong> “Can we reconnect within 24 hours after disagreements?”</li>
        <li><strong>Lower the bar:</strong> aim for short, calm repair talks—not full resolutions</li>
        <li><strong>Track patterns:</strong> consistency matters more than one good conversation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Repair scripts that reduce defensiveness</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I’m not reopening the argument. I’m asking to reconnect emotionally.”</li>
        <li>“Can we spend five minutes naming what we felt and move forward?”</li>
        <li>“When we don’t repair, I carry it longer than the conflict itself.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When avoiding repair becomes a relationship issue</h2>
      <p>
        If repair continues to be avoided after clear, calm requests, the issue is not communication style—
        it’s emotional availability. Healthy relationships repair repeatedly, even imperfectly.
