      <h1>Guarded / Unavailable</h1>
      <p class="muted">Emotional Availability Test — Result Profile</p>

      <p>
        Your result suggests a pattern of <strong>emotional guardedness</strong> or <strong>emotional unavailability</strong>.
        In many relationships, this shows up as limited emotional intimacy: feelings are minimized, deflected, or handled at a distance,
        especially when vulnerability is required. The hardest part is often not the conflict—it’s the sense that your emotions are
        not fully “welcome” in the relationship.
      </p>

      <h2>Common signs of emotional unavailability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Vulnerable topics are met with logic, jokes, defensiveness, or quick shutdown</li>
        <li>Feelings are minimized (“It’s not a big deal” / “You’re too sensitive”)</li>
        <li>Closeness is easier when things are light, harder when you need emotional support</li>
        <li>Repair conversations are avoided or rushed</li>
        <li>You feel like you must “earn” attention or keep emotions small to stay connected</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why this pattern hurts over time</h2>
      <p>
        When emotional support is inconsistent or unavailable, you may start self-silencing—asking for less, sharing less, and carrying
        stress alone. Many people describe the experience as being “in a relationship” while still feeling emotionally alone.
      </p>

      <h2>What to do next (specific, ad-safe)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make one clear request:</strong> “I need 2 minutes of listening-first, then a reflection of what you heard.”</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for clarity:</strong> “When I’m upset, what is your usual response—space, help, or shutdown?”</li>
        <li><strong>Set a repair expectation:</strong> “After conflict, can we reconnect within 24 hours?”</li>
        <li><strong>Track follow-through:</strong> real change is consistent behavior, not one good talk</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scripts that reduce defensiveness</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I’m not blaming you. I’m asking for connection. Can you stay with me for two minutes?”</li>
        <li>“I don’t need fixing. I need presence. Can you reflect what you heard me say?”</li>
        <li>“If you need space, can you name a return time so I’m not left guessing?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When it becomes a relationship problem (not just a personality style)</h2>
      <p>
        If your needs are repeatedly dismissed, vulnerability is punished, and repair rarely happens even after direct requests,
        the pattern matters more than the explanation. Emotional intimacy requires willingness, not just feelings.
