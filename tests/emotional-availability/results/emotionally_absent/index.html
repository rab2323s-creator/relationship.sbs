      <h1>Emotionally Absent</h1>
      <p class="muted">Emotional Availability Test — Result Profile</p>

      <p>
        Your result suggests a pattern of <strong>emotional absence</strong>. Many people describe this as being “in a relationship”
        while still feeling emotionally alone: conversations stay surface-level, emotional support feels missing, and repair after tension
        is rare. Over time, this can lead to self-silencing—sharing less, asking less, and carrying the emotional load alone.
      </p>

      <h2>Common signs of emotional absence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You feel unsupported when you’re stressed, sad, or overwhelmed</li>
        <li>Your feelings are dismissed, ignored, or met with cold distance</li>
        <li>Repair after conflict doesn’t happen (or you’re the only one trying)</li>
        <li>Requests for clarity lead to vagueness, defensiveness, or silence</li>
        <li>You stop bringing things up because it feels pointless</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why this hurts so much</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional absence is not just “less romance.” It affects emotional safety. When you can’t rely on emotional support,
        your nervous system stays on alert. Many people respond by shrinking their needs or becoming hyper-independent—until
        the relationship feels more like coexistence than connection.
      </p>

      <h2>What to do next (specific, ad-safe)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make one clear request:</strong> “I need two minutes of listening-first, not fixing.”</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for a concrete check-in:</strong> “Can we talk tonight at 8 for 10 minutes?”</li>
        <li><strong>Set a repair expectation:</strong> “After conflict, we reconnect within 24 hours.”</li>
        <li><strong>Watch behavior, not promises:</strong> improvement is consistent follow-through</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scripts for emotional neglect and disconnection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I’m not asking for perfection. I’m asking for presence. Can you stay with me for two minutes?”</li>
        <li>“If you need space, please name a return time so I’m not left alone in this.”</li>
        <li>“When I’m vulnerable and I’m met with silence, I feel emotionally alone. I need a different response.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to take this result seriously</h2>
      <p>
        If emotional support stays absent after clear requests, repair remains rare, and your needs are repeatedly minimized,
        treat the pattern as information. Emotional intimacy requires willingness and repeated effort.
