      <h1>Inconsistent Presence</h1>
      <p class="muted">Emotional Availability Test — Result Profile</p>

      <p>
        Your result suggests <strong>inconsistent emotional availability</strong>. Care exists, but emotional support can feel
        unpredictable—present in calm moments, distant during stress, or engaged only when conversations stay “easy.”
        Over time, inconsistency can be more destabilizing than clear distance, because your nervous system keeps waiting
        for connection to return.
      </p>

      <h2>What this pattern often looks like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Warm and attentive one day, emotionally distant the next</li>
        <li>Support shows up when things are light, but fades when you’re vulnerable</li>
        <li>You receive reassurance sometimes—then silence or vagueness later</li>
        <li>Conflict ends without clear repair, so closeness feels fragile</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why it feels so confusing</h2>
      <p>
        Inconsistency creates “mixed signals.” You may start overthinking texts, tone, and timing—trying to predict when emotional
        support will be available. Many people respond by asking less, becoming smaller, or doing emotional work alone to avoid
        feeling rejected.
      </p>

      <h2>What to do next (specific, ad-safe)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Make one clear request:</strong> ask for listening-first for 2 minutes (no fixing) and one follow-up check-in</li>
        <li><strong>Set a timeframe:</strong> “If we have tension, can we repair within 24 hours?”</li>
        <li><strong>Stop guessing—start tracking:</strong> look for repeatable follow-through over time</li>
        <li><strong>Name the pattern calmly:</strong> “Sometimes you’re very present, and sometimes you disappear emotionally. I need consistency.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scripts you can use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I don’t need advice—just presence. Can you listen for 2 minutes and reflect what you heard?”</li>
        <li>“If you’re overwhelmed, can you say ‘I care, I need time, I’ll check in at ___’ so I’m not left guessing?”</li>
        <li>“Can we agree on a repair routine after conflict—so we reconnect instead of drifting?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When inconsistency becomes a deal-breaker</h2>
      <p>
        If your needs are repeatedly minimized, repair rarely happens, and inconsistency stays the norm even after clear requests,
        treat that as information—not a misunderstanding.
