      <h1>Present Partner</h1>
      <p class="muted">Emotional Availability Test — Result Profile</p>

      <p>
        Your result suggests a strong pattern of <strong>emotional availability</strong>. In practical terms, this tends to look like
        emotional presence, clearer communication, and <strong>repair after conflict</strong>—so emotional support feels real and
        consistent rather than dependent on mood, timing, or convenience.
      </p>

      <h2>What this result often means</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emotional support is consistent:</strong> empathy shows up even during stress</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity is available:</strong> “Are we okay?” leads to a real conversation, not vagueness</li>
        <li><strong>Repair happens:</strong> tension is followed by reconnection, not distance</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-through:</strong> caring words match repeatable actions over time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Green flags to notice (and protect)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You feel safer being honest—less “walking on eggshells”</li>
        <li>Needs can be discussed without shame, guilt, or punishment</li>
        <li>Accountability is possible without turning it into blame</li>
        <li>Conflict doesn’t erase closeness; it gets repaired</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep a weekly check-in:</strong> 5–10 minutes, one “what worked” + one “what would help”</li>
        <li><strong>Use listening-first:</strong> “Do you want comfort, advice, or both?”</li>
        <li><strong>Agree on a repair rule:</strong> after conflict, reconnect within 24 hours</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick scripts (ad-safe)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I don’t need fixing—just presence. Can you reflect what you heard for 30 seconds?”</li>
        <li>“Can we do a quick reset? I want us to reconnect after that moment.”</li>
        <li>“What would help you feel supported this week—and what would help me?”</li>
      </ul>
