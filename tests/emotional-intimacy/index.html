      <h2>Emotional Intimacy Test — the questions you feel in your body before you answer</h2>
      <p>If you’ve searched <strong>“lack of emotional intimacy”</strong> or <strong>“emotional distance in relationship”</strong>, you already know the feeling: you’re together — but you don’t feel <em>met</em>. This test is built to pinpoint the pattern, not blame a person.</p>

      <h3>What this emotional intimacy quiz measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emotional safety:</strong> can you speak honestly without paying a price?</li>
        <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> do you feel cared for, or managed?</li>
        <li><strong>Repair:</strong> does conflict end in reconnection or avoidance?</li>
        <li><strong>Balance:</strong> who carries the emotional work in the relationship?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why the questions start strong</h3>
      <p>Many quizzes stay vague. These questions start where real intimacy lives: the moment you need reassurance, the moment you hesitate to speak, the moment you feel lonely next to someone you love. Each scenario is designed to reveal what your relationship does <em>under pressure</em>.</p>

      <h3>Important note</h3>
      <p>This test is safe for ads and avoids explicit content. It focuses on emotional connection and communication patterns, not sexual content or medical diagnosis.</p>
