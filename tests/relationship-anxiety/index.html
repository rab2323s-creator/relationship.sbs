      <h2>Read This First (It Might Hit Too Close)</h2>

      <h3>If your mind spirals faster than your relationship can prove reality…</h3>
      <p>
        Relationship anxiety is rarely loud on the outside. Most of the time, it looks like you’re “fine.” You reply normally.
        You don’t beg. You don’t chase. You don’t want to be “too much.”
        But inside? A single late reply can feel like a cliff edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        One word in a text can change your entire mood. A tone shift can trigger a full internal investigation.
        You might even ask yourself the question you hate the most: <em>“Am I too anxious in my relationship?”</em>
        This Relationship Anxiety Test is designed to feel painfully accurate — without diagnosing you,
        without blaming you, and without pretending love is simple.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Relationship Anxiety Feels So Real</h2>

      <h3>It’s not “neediness.” It’s nervous-system math.</h3>
      <p>
        When connection feels uncertain, your brain tries to protect you by scanning for danger. That can create
        <strong>overthinking in relationships</strong>, emotional checking, and obsessive meaning-making from tiny details.
      </p>

      <h3>Texts became a “threat detector.”</h3>
      <p>
        Modern love is full of micro-signals: “seen,” late replies, short messages, heart reactions, story views.
        If you’ve ever felt <strong>anxiety after texting</strong>, you already know how brutal ambiguity can be.
      </p>

      <h3>The fear behind it is usually the same.</h3>
      <p>
        Under the surface, relationship anxiety often overlaps with <strong>anxious attachment</strong>,
        <strong>attachment anxiety</strong>, and a deep <strong>fear of abandonment</strong>.
        The pain isn’t random — it’s your body trying to prevent heartbreak before it happens.
      </p>

      <h3>Most people don’t realize this…</h3>
      <p>
        Relationship anxiety doesn’t always come from a “bad relationship.” Sometimes it comes from a relationship that’s
        good — but unfamiliar. When someone actually matters to you, your nervous system stops treating love like a game…
        and starts treating it like survival.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h3>Share your results</h3>
      <p>
        If this test felt painfully accurate, share your result with someone you trust — or with your partner.
        Sometimes clarity is the first kind of intimacy.

      <h2>Relationship Anxiety FAQ (SEO)</h2>

      <h3>What is relationship anxiety?</h3>
      <p>
        Relationship anxiety is ongoing worry, doubt, and emotional hyper-alertness in romantic connection.
        It often shows up as overthinking in relationships, asking for constant reassurance, and feeling emotionally unsafe
        when there’s silence, distance, or mixed signals. It doesn’t automatically mean the relationship is unhealthy —
        but it does mean your nervous system is struggling with uncertainty.
      </p>

      <h3>Can relationship anxiety ruin relationships?</h3>
      <p>
        It can create strain when anxiety drives repeated conflict, suspicion, or emotional tests. But relationship anxiety
        can also become a relationship strength when it’s understood and managed. The key is shifting from panic-reactions
        to communication, boundaries, and self-soothing — so fear of abandonment doesn’t become the loudest voice in the room.
      </p>

      <h3>Is relationship anxiety the same as anxious attachment?</h3>
      <p>
        They overlap. Anxious attachment describes a tendency to fear abandonment, crave reassurance, and react strongly to
        distance. Relationship anxiety can be situational (triggered by one relationship) or broader (a repeating pattern).
        This Relationship Anxiety Test is designed to reflect both, using real modern triggers like texting, tone shifts, and silence.
      </p>

      <h3>Why do I need constant reassurance in my relationship?</h3>
      <p>
        Needing constant reassurance usually comes from uncertainty feeling unbearable. When your brain can’t “predict”
        closeness, it searches for proof: extra messages, checking their mood, re-reading texts. Reassurance works for a moment —
        then fades. Learning to regulate the emotional wave first can reduce the need for reassurance to feel like oxygen.
      </p>

      <h3>Why do I panic when they don’t text back? (anxiety after texting)</h3>
      <p>
        Anxiety after texting often happens when a delayed reply feels like rejection. Silence becomes a screen your fear projects onto.
        The mind jumps to worst-case scenarios, especially if you’ve experienced abandonment before. A practical first step:
        stop interpreting time as meaning. Then create communication expectations that respect both people’s pace.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I stop overthinking in relationships without becoming cold?</h3>
      <p>
        Overthinking doesn’t mean you love too much — it means uncertainty hurts too much. Try this long-tail approach:
        <strong>“How to stop overthinking in relationships without losing feelings”</strong> starts with separating facts from stories,
        delaying reactive texts, and practicing direct questions instead of hidden tests. Warm love and calm love can coexist.
      </p>
