      <h1>Are You Settling? Test Results</h1>

      <p>
        These result pages explain five common patterns people search for when they feel stuck:
        <strong>unmet needs</strong>, <strong>low effort</strong>, <strong>unclear commitment</strong>,
        <strong>inconsistent communication</strong>, and <strong>quiet self-abandonment</strong>.
        They’re designed to be readable, shareable, and practical (ad-safe, educational, non-clinical).
      </p>

      <div class="row" style="flex-wrap:wrap; gap:10px; margin-top:12px;">
        <a class="btn" href="/tests/are-you-settling/#quiz">Take the full Are You Settling? test</a>
        <a class="btn secondary" href="#profiles">Jump to profiles</a>
        <a class="btn secondary" href="#next">What to do after your result</a>
      </div>

      <h2>How to use these results (without overthinking)</h2>
      <p>
        Treat your profile like a mirror, not a verdict. The key question is simple:
        <strong>When you ask clearly, does behavior change consistently over time?</strong>
        A relationship can survive a rough patch. It can’t thrive on permanent vagueness.
      </p>

      <h2>Settling vs. a rough patch (the fast rule)</h2>
      <p>
        A rough patch improves with <strong>repair + follow-through</strong>. Settling feels like you keep adapting,
        but the baseline stays the same. Use a three-step check:
        <strong>(1) Ask</strong> for one measurable change,
        <strong>(2) Agree</strong> on what success looks like,
        <strong>(3) Watch</strong> behavior for 2–4 weeks. Patterns are the answer.
      </p>

      <h2>Common search signals (why people land here)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“Am I settling in my relationship?”</li>
        <li>“My needs are not met but I don’t want to leave.”</li>
        <li>“Low effort partner — should I stay?”</li>
        <li>“Unclear commitment / situationship signs.”</li>
        <li>“Emotionally unavailable partner — what do I do?”</li>
      </ul>
