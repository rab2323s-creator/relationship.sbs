      <h1>Are You Settling? Test Results</h1>

      <h2>Read this before you click your profile</h2>
      <h3>Results are about patterns—not labels.</h3>
      <p>
        These profiles describe common “settling” dynamics: unmet needs, inconsistent effort, and the slow habit of making
        yourself smaller to keep love. This is an educational tool—ad-safe, non-clinical—and it’s most useful when you read your
        result like a mirror: not to blame anyone, but to get honest about what the relationship costs you.
      </p>

      <h2>Choose your result profile</h2>
      <h3>All five profiles include scripts and next steps.</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/are-you-settling/results/grounded_and_met/"><strong>Grounded &amp; Met</strong></a><br />
          <span class="muted">Your needs have a place here. Effort and respect show up consistently.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/are-you-settling/results/needs_noticed_not_met/"><strong>Needs Noticed (Not Fully Met)</strong></a><br />
          <span class="muted">Connection exists, but follow-through is inconsistent. The gap is small but real.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/are-you-settling/results/quiet_settling/"><strong>Quiet Settling</strong></a><br />
          <span class="muted">You’re smiling through unmet needs. Calm on the outside, lonely on the inside.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/are-you-settling/results/self_abandonment_loop/"><strong>Self-Abandonment Loop</strong></a><br />
          <span class="muted">You may be negotiating your worth to keep love—over-explaining, chasing, and shrinking.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/tests/are-you-settling/results/under_investment_reality/"><strong>Under-Investment Reality</strong></a><br />
          <span class="muted">The effort may be convenience-based. Plans stay vague, follow-through stays weak.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick reminder</h2>
      <h3>One clean request beats a thousand explanations.</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re unsure which profile fits, start with the question: “When I ask clearly, does behavior change over time?”
        Consistency is the signal.
      </p>
