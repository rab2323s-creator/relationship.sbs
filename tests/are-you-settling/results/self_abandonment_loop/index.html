        Are You Settling? Test — Result Preview (ad-safe, educational)
      </p>

      <p>
        This result often shows up when uncertainty activates attachment: you may <strong>over-explain</strong>, <strong>edit yourself</strong>,
        or chase reassurance because the alternative feels like losing the relationship. This doesn’t mean you’re “too much.”
        It means the relationship (or the communication pattern) is not providing stable enough safety—so your nervous system tries
        to earn security through effort.
      </p>

      <div class="row" style="flex-wrap:wrap; gap:10px; margin-top:12px;">
        <a class="btn" href="/tests/are-you-settling/#quiz">Take the full test (personalized)</a>

      </div>

      <h2>What this pattern often looks like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You send a “simple” message—then rewrite it repeatedly to avoid rejection.</li>
        <li>Silence triggers panic, so you initiate, clarify, and repair more than feels fair.</li>
        <li>You feel relief only after reassurance—then the anxiety returns.</li>
        <li>Your needs start to feel like a liability you must manage “correctly.”</li>
        <li>You accept less consistency because you’re focused on keeping connection alive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The key shift: from chasing reassurance to tracking reality</h2>
      <p>
        The most helpful move here is to stop negotiating your worth in real time. Replace spiraling texts with a simple structure:
        <strong>one request</strong>, <strong>one timeline</strong>, <strong>one data decision</strong>. This turns emotional chaos into clarity.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick checklist (search-intent signals)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I keep <strong>overthinking texts</strong> and reading into delays.”</li>
        <li>“I send a message, then want to follow up immediately.”</li>
        <li>“I’m afraid if I stop trying, the relationship will fade.”</li>
        <li>“I’m always explaining my feelings so they won’t leave.”</li>
        <li>“I feel ‘needy’ for wanting consistency.”</li>
        <li>“Their attention is hot-and-cold, and I’m stuck in the cycle.”</li>
        <li>“I apologize for needs and then feel ashamed.”</li>
        <li>“I chase clarity, but it stays vague.”</li>
        <li>“I feel calm only when I’m reassured.”</li>
        <li>“I’m negotiating my worth to keep love.”</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use a “one-message rule” when triggered:</strong> one clear message, then pause (no chasing, no spiraling).</li>
        <li><strong>Make one measurable request</strong> (clarity, follow-through, consistent contact) with a timeline (2–4 weeks).</li>
        <li><strong>Track patterns, not promises.</strong> Reassurance is not the same as consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Build self-trust rituals:</strong> facts list, grounding, and a short delay before sending follow-ups.</li>
