        Are You Settling? Test — Result Preview (ad-safe, educational)
      </p>

      <p>
        This result usually shows up when the relationship has real connection—but there’s a <strong>small, persistent gap</strong>
        between what you need and what consistently happens. You may recognize patterns like <strong>inconsistent effort</strong>,
        <strong>unclear plans</strong>, or “good weeks” followed by drop-offs. The goal here isn’t to label anyone.
        It’s to reduce guesswork by turning the dynamic into clear, trackable data.
      </p>

      <div class="row" style="flex-wrap:wrap; gap:10px; margin-top:12px;">
        <a class="btn" href="/tests/are-you-settling/#quiz">Take the full test (personalized)</a>
        <a class="btn secondary" href="/tests/are-you-settling/results/">See all result types</a>
        <a class="btn secondary" href="#next">What to do next</a>
      </div>

      <h2>What this pattern often looks like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You <strong>notice unmet needs</strong> (consistency, clarity, follow-through), but you keep adapting.</li>
        <li>Requests lead to short-term improvement, then the relationship resets back to the old baseline.</li>
        <li>You carry more of the <strong>planning and emotional labor</strong> than you want to admit.</li>
        <li>You wonder: <strong>“Is this just a rough patch… or a stable pattern?”</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Settling vs. a rough patch (the “one measurable change” rule)</h2>
      <p>
        The cleanest way to tell the difference is to ask for <strong>one measurable change</strong> and observe follow-through:
        not one good day—an actual pattern over time.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make one specific request</strong> (short, concrete, respectful).</li>
        <li><strong>Agree on what success looks like</strong> (a plan, a habit, a timeline).</li>
        <li><strong>Track behavior for 2–4 weeks</strong>. If effort is mostly vague, inconsistent, or temporary, the gap is real.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Quick checklist (search-intent signals people report)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I feel <strong>unfulfilled</strong> but I can’t justify leaving.”</li>
        <li>“They <strong>mean well</strong>… but follow-through is inconsistent.”</li>
        <li>“I keep asking for clarity and get <strong>vague answers</strong>.”</li>
        <li>“I’m doing more of the effort, texts, and repair.”</li>
        <li>“When I stop initiating, the relationship gets quiet.”</li>
        <li>“I feel guilty for wanting <strong>basic consistency</strong>.”</li>
        <li>“I keep lowering my needs so I don’t sound demanding.”</li>
        <li>“I’m not sure if this is <strong>compatibility</strong> or timing.”</li>
        <li>“I want to stay—but I also want to stop guessing.”</li>
        <li>“I need a plan, not maybes.”</li>
      </ul>
