        Are You Settling? Test — Result Preview (ad-safe, educational)
      </p>

      <p>
        This result often shows up when your discomfort is <strong>data</strong>, not insecurity. The pattern may feel
        <strong>convenience-based</strong>: effort shows up when it’s easy, but fades when it requires planning, consistency,
        accountability, or emotional presence. You may find yourself adapting to vagueness—waiting, guessing, and carrying
        the relationship’s momentum alone.
      </p>

      <div class="row" style="flex-wrap:wrap; gap:10px; margin-top:12px;">
        <a class="btn" href="/tests/are-you-settling/#quiz">Take the full test (personalized)</a>
        <a class="btn secondary" href="/tests/are-you-settling/results/">See all result types</a>
        <a class="btn secondary" href="#next">What to do next</a>
      </div>

      <h2>What this pattern often looks like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low effort</strong> shows up as vague plans, weak follow-through, or last-minute cancellations.</li>
        <li>Clarity is hard to get because the relationship benefits from staying <strong>undefined</strong>.</li>
        <li>Communication can feel <strong>inconsistent</strong> (attention comes and goes).</li>
        <li>When you stop initiating, the relationship gets quiet—until they want attention again.</li>
        <li>You’re adapting to less and calling it “understanding” to avoid losing the connection.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Compatibility vs. investment (the question that cuts through fog)</h2>
      <p>
        The point isn’t to diagnose anyone. The point is to ask: <strong>Does this relationship reliably meet your needs?</strong>
        If your needs are basic (consistency, respect, emotional presence) and the pattern stays vague, the issue may be
        investment—not communication.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick checklist (search-intent signals)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I feel like I’m in a <strong>situationship</strong>—not a committed relationship.”</li>
        <li>“Plans are always <strong>vague</strong> and I’m the one confirming.”</li>
        <li>“They show up when it benefits them, then disappear.”</li>
        <li>“I’m afraid if I ask for clarity, I’ll be labeled needy.”</li>
        <li>“I keep waiting for effort to increase, but it doesn’t.”</li>
        <li>“The connection is strong in fun moments, weak in real-life follow-through.”</li>
        <li>“I’m accepting crumbs and trying to convince myself it’s enough.”</li>
        <li>“When I stop chasing, the relationship fades.”</li>
        <li>“I’m not sure whether to stay or leave, but I feel unfulfilled.”</li>
        <li>“I need a steady plan—not maybes.”</li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Ask for one measurable change</strong> (a real plan + follow-through) within 2–4 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Hold the line:</strong> don’t negotiate basics with long explanations. One request, one timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Track patterns, not potential.</strong> If it stays vague, treat that as the answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Use boundaries to protect peace,</strong> not to force a response.</li>
