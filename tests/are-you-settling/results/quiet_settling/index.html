        Are You Settling? Test — Result Preview (ad-safe, educational)
      </p>

      <p>
        This result often appears when the relationship looks calm on the outside—but inside you’re carrying
        <strong>quiet disappointment</strong>. “Quiet settling” is rarely dramatic. It’s the slow habit of self-silencing:
        editing needs, avoiding hard conversations, and calling <strong>low effort</strong> “normal” to keep the peace.
        The main signal isn’t constant conflict. It’s <strong>quiet loneliness</strong> and the feeling that you’re doing
        emotional math alone.
      </p>

      <div class="row" style="flex-wrap:wrap; gap:10px; margin-top:12px;">
        <a class="btn" href="/tests/are-you-settling/#quiz">Take the full test (personalized)</a>

        <a class="btn secondary" href="#next">What to do next</a>
      </div>

      <h2>What this pattern often looks like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You don’t ask for what you need because you’re tired of being disappointed.</li>
        <li>You “make it easier” for them by shrinking your needs for consistency, reassurance, or clarity.</li>
        <li>You feel <strong>emotionally alone</strong> even when you’re in a relationship.</li>
        <li>You avoid conflict, but the cost is that nothing changes.</li>
        <li>You accept crumbs and tell yourself you’re being “mature.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quiet settling vs. a peaceful relationship (the difference)</h2>
      <p>
        A peaceful relationship feels safe because repair is possible. Quiet settling feels “peaceful” because you stop
        bringing up needs. A quick test: when you imagine asking for one clear change—do you feel calm, or do you feel
        dread that you’ll be judged, dismissed, or ignored?
      </p>

      <h2>Quick checklist (search-intent signals)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I keep telling myself <strong>it’s fine</strong>, but I don’t feel chosen.”</li>
        <li>“I’m in a relationship and still feel <strong>lonely</strong>.”</li>
        <li>“I don’t ask anymore because it never leads to change.”</li>
        <li>“I’m afraid of sounding needy for wanting basic consistency.”</li>
        <li>“I minimize my feelings so we don’t fight.”</li>
        <li>“They’re nice—but effort is <strong>inconsistent</strong> or vague.”</li>
        <li>“I accept low effort and call it understanding.”</li>
        <li>“I carry the planning, the check-ins, and the repair.”</li>
        <li>“I miss the version of me who used to take up space.”</li>
        <li>“I’m waiting for them to notice… but they don’t.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Next steps (from quiet settling to clear data)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Name one hidden need</strong> you’ve been downplaying (clarity, consistent effort, emotional presence).</li>
        <li><strong>Ask once, clearly</strong>—short request, measurable agreement, no over-explaining.</li>
        <li><strong>Track follow-through for 2–4 weeks.</strong> If nothing shifts, the issue isn’t your wording—it’s the pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose self-respect over silence.</strong> Peace that costs you your voice isn’t peace.</li>
