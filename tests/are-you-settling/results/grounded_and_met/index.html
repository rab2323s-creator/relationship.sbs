      </p>

      <p>
        This result suggests a healthy baseline: you’re unlikely to be <strong>accepting less than you need</strong> to keep love.
        In practical terms, the relationship tends to include <strong>consistent effort</strong>, <strong>mutual repair</strong>,
        and enough <strong>emotional availability</strong> that you don’t have to chase basics like clarity, follow-through, or respect.
      </p>

      <h2>What this profile usually means</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You don’t feel shame for needs like consistency, reassurance, or clear plans.</li>
        <li>When something goes wrong, there’s <strong>repair</strong>—not silence, punishment, or blame-shifting.</li>
        <li>Effort is visible in actions (not just words), so trust builds through patterns.</li>
        <li>You can be yourself without shrinking, auditioning, or over-explaining.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick self-check (still useful, even in healthy relationships)</h2>
      <p>
        Being “Grounded &amp; Met” doesn’t mean everything is perfect. It means the <strong>overall pattern</strong> supports you.
        If you want a reality check, ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When life gets stressful, does effort stay <strong>reliable</strong> or drop into “convenience only”?</li>
        <li>Can you name one boundary that’s respected without consequences?</li>
        <li>Do you feel safe to bring up a need without managing their reaction first?</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Protect consistency:</strong> keep one small relationship ritual (a weekly check-in, a walk, a plan-confirm habit).</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforce repair:</strong> name what went well after conflict—healthy dynamics grow through feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay anchored:</strong> a stable relationship isn’t your entire identity; keep friends, goals, and meaning outside love.</li>
