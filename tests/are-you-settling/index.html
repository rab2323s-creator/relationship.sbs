    {"@type":"Question","name":"What does it mean to settle in a relationship?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Settling usually means accepting a pattern that doesn’t meet your needs—often by shrinking your wants, ignoring recurring disappointments, or making peace with low effort to avoid losing the relationship."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Am I settling or just going through a rough patch?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A rough patch improves with repair and follow-through. Settling feels like you keep adapting, but the core pattern stays the same—especially around effort, respect, communication, and emotional availability."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Why do I stay even when I feel unfulfilled?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Many people stay because of attachment, hope, fear of starting over, or the belief that asking for more is ‘too much.’ This test helps you separate hope from repeated reality."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Is this test a diagnosis?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. This is an educational self-reflection quiz. It does not diagnose attachment style or mental health conditions, and it does not replace professional support."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"How do I ask for more without sounding needy?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Use a short, specific request and a measurable agreement. The key is clarity plus follow-through—not long explanations. This test includes scripts you can use."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What if they don’t change after I communicate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Then the data is in the pattern. If requests are clear and respectful, and nothing shifts over time, it may be a compatibility or investment issue—not a communication issue."}}

      <h1>Are You Settling in Your Relationship? Take This Test to Find Out</h1>

      <h2>Read This First (It Might Hit Too Close)</h2>
      <h3>If you’ve been saying “it’s fine” while feeling quietly lonely—this is for you.</h3>
      <p>
        Settling rarely looks like a dramatic breakup moment. It looks like you adjusting your needs down in tiny ways:
        laughing off the missed plans, forgiving the same apology, calling basic effort “not their love language.”
        You tell yourself you’re being mature—until you realize you’ve been <strong>carrying the emotional weight alone</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This <strong>Are You Settling? Test</strong> is built to reveal silent patterns: low effort that feels normal now,
        emotional availability that shows up only when it’s convenient, and the slow habit of making yourself smaller to keep love.
        It’s designed to be <strong>high-retention</strong>, deeply personal, and <strong>Google Ads / AdSense safe</strong> (no diagnosis, no medical claims).
      </p>

      <h2>Why Settling Feels So Hard to Admit</h2>
      <h3>Because your brain protects the hope.</h3>
      <p>
        Hope can be beautiful—until it becomes a strategy to tolerate the same disappointment.
        When you’re attached, your mind will search for reasons to stay: stress, timing, trauma, “they mean well.”
        This test separates compassion from self-abandonment.
      </p>

      <h3>Because settling is often a “death by a thousand maybes.”</h3>
      <p>
        It’s not one big betrayal. It’s the repeated small moments where you ask, and nothing changes.
      </p>

      <h3>Most people don’t realize this…</h3>
      <p>
        The deepest sign of settling isn’t what they do. It’s what you stop doing: asking, expressing, expecting, planning,
        and letting your needs take up space.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Test Measures (And What It Doesn’t)</h2>
      <h3>What it measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Effort and follow-through (plans, consistency, reliability)</li>
        <li>Emotional availability (presence, curiosity, repair)</li>
        <li>Respect patterns (boundaries, tone, accountability)</li>
        <li>Self-abandonment signals (shrinking needs, over-explaining, accepting crumbs)</li>
        <li>Compatibility vs. wishful thinking</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What it doesn’t</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No diagnosis, no labeling people</li>
        <li>No promises or “guaranteed outcomes”</li>
        <li>No graphic content; educational and ad-safe</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>15 scenarios. Answer fast—your first impulse is the truth.</h3>

      <h2>Your Results</h2>
      <h3>Five profiles (your engine calculates automatically)</h3>

        You’ll land in one of five profiles: Grounded & Met, Needs Noticed (Not Fully Met), Quiet Settling,
        Self-Abandonment Loop, or Under-Investment Reality.
      </p>

      <h2>What To Do Next</h2>
      <h3>The goal isn’t to demand more. It’s to stop negotiating your worth.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make one clear request. Watch behavior for 2–4 weeks.</li>
        <li>Trade long explanations for measurable agreements.</li>
