    {"@type":"Question","name":"What does it mean to settle in a relationship?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Settling usually means accepting a pattern that doesn’t meet your needs—often by shrinking your wants, ignoring recurring disappointments, or making peace with low effort to avoid losing the relationship."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Am I settling or just going through a rough patch?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A rough patch improves with repair and follow-through. Settling feels like you keep adapting, but the core pattern stays the same—especially around effort, respect, communication, and emotional availability."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Why do I stay even when I feel unfulfilled?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Many people stay because of attachment, hope, fear of starting over, or the belief that asking for more is ‘too much.’ This test helps you separate hope from repeated reality."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Is this test a diagnosis?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. This is an educational self-reflection quiz. It does not diagnose mental health conditions and it does not replace professional support."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"How do I ask for more without sounding needy?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Use a short, specific request and a measurable agreement. The key is clarity plus follow-through—not long explanations. This test includes scripts you can use."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What if they don’t change after I communicate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Then the data is in the pattern. If requests are clear and respectful, and nothing shifts over time, it may be a compatibility or investment issue—not a communication issue."}}

      <h1>Are You Settling in Your Relationship? Take the Test</h1>

      <p>
        If you keep Googling <strong>“am I settling in my relationship?”</strong>, <strong>“needs not met”</strong>,
        <strong>“low effort partner”</strong>, <strong>“unclear commitment”</strong>, or <strong>“emotionally unavailable”</strong>—
        this page is built for that exact moment: when you’re trying to tell the difference between a rough patch and a repeated pattern.
      </p>
       <p class="hero-line">
  <strong>Are you in a relationship… or just trying not to lose one?</strong>
</p>

      <div class="row" style="flex-wrap:wrap; gap:10px; margin-top:12px;">

      <h2>What “settling” usually looks like (in real life)</h2>
      <p class="lead-in">
  Most people don’t notice they’re settling. They notice the silence first.
</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Effort drops</strong> and you start normalizing it (“they’re busy”).</li>
        <li><strong>Plans stay vague</strong> and you become the organizer, the confirmer, and the repair person.</li>
        <li><strong>Your needs get edited</strong> so you don’t sound “too much.”</li>
        <li><strong>Boundaries trigger guilt</strong> instead of respect.</li>
        <li>You feel <strong>quietly lonely</strong> even when you’re technically “together.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What this test measures</h2>
      <p>
        This is an educational self-reflection quiz (ad-safe; no diagnosis). It focuses on practical relationship signals:
        <strong>consistency</strong>, <strong>follow-through</strong>, <strong>emotional availability</strong>, <strong>respect</strong>,
        and <strong>self-abandonment patterns</strong> (where you shrink yourself to keep the connection).

      <h2>Scenario preview (paraphrased to avoid duplicated text)</h2>
      <p>
        The test uses 15 quick scenarios. Answer fast—your first reaction usually tells the truth.
        Here are examples of what you’ll respond to (written differently than the quiz text):
      </p>

      <div class="grid2">
        <div class="mini">
          <h3>Consistency & effort</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Plans change at the last minute—do you expect a real reschedule, or do you swallow it?</li>
            <li>If you stop initiating, does the relationship go silent?</li>
            <li>Do you feel chosen consistently—or only when it’s convenient?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="mini">
          <h3>Clarity & commitment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When you ask “where is this going?”, do you get a clear answer or a foggy one?</li>
            <li>Do jokes/deflection replace real conversations about the future?</li>
            <li>Does asking for clarity get turned into “you’re needy”?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="mini">
          <h3>Boundaries & respect</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When you set a boundary, do they adapt—or punish you with guilt and withdrawal?</li>
            <li>Do you feel safe bringing up an issue without managing their emotions first?</li>
            <li>Is accountability part of the relationship, or something you’re not allowed to request?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="mini">
          <h3>Self-abandonment signals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Do you rewrite texts over and over to avoid rejection?</li>
            <li>Do you minimize your needs to “keep the peace”?</li>
            <li>Do you find yourself coaching, reminding, and carrying the emotional labor?</li>
          </ul>

    <section class="card prose" id="next">
      <h2>What to do if you suspect you’re settling</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make one measurable request.</strong> Example: a specific plan + confirmation habit.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch behavior for 2–4 weeks.</strong> Track follow-through, not promises.</li>
        <li><strong>Replace long explanations with clear boundaries.</strong> One ask, one timeline, then data.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop negotiating basics.</strong> Consistency, respect, and effort are not “too much.”</li>
