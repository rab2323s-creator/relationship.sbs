    {"@type":"Question","name":"How to text an avoidant without pushing them away?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Keep messages clear, low-pressure, and time-bounded. Avoid rapid-fire follow-ups, mind-reading, or emotional tests. Use one direct request + a calm option for later. Consistency matters more than intensity."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What does avoidant attachment style texting look like?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It can look like delayed replies, short responses, disappearing after closeness, or warmth followed by distance. Context matters: stress, work, and habits can mimic avoidant patterns, so look for repeated cycles over time."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"How often to text an avoidant?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"There’s no universal number. A helpful rule is: send one clear message, then wait. If you need predictability, agree on a simple rhythm (e.g., one check-in daily) instead of guessing and escalating."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Are they avoidant or just not that interested?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Avoidant patterns still show effort (plans, follow-through, care), just with discomfort around closeness. Low interest looks like minimal investment, vague plans, and weak follow-through over time. This test helps you separate ‘needs space’ from ‘not investing.’"}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Is it healthy to do no contact after a breakup?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No contact after break up can be healthy when it protects your healing, reduces emotional spirals, and stops repeated reopening of wounds. It’s not a guarantee to get someone back—it’s a boundary that gives your nervous system room to reset."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Is this Avoidant Texting Test a diagnosis?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. This is an educational self-reflection quiz based on common relationship and communication patterns. It does not diagnose attachment style or mental health conditions."}}

      <h2>Avoidant texting test: when silence feels louder than words</h2>
      <p>
        If you’ve searched <strong>“how to text an avoidant”</strong>, <strong>“avoidant attachment style texting”</strong>, or
        <strong>“how often to text an avoidant”</strong>, you’re not looking for cute advice. You’re trying to stop the cycle:
        closeness → distance → overthinking → chasing → feeling embarrassed for caring.
      </p>

      <h3>What this test is built to do (and why it feels so accurate)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Decode patterns:</strong> is it avoidant space, hot-cold inconsistency, or low investment?</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce spirals:</strong> stop guessing games and replace them with one clean message.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect your self-respect:</strong> scripts that don’t beg, test, or threaten.</li>
        <li><strong>Make texting simple again:</strong> boundaries that feel calm—not controlling.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Most people miss this (and it costs them the relationship)</h3>
      <p>
        The biggest mistake isn’t “texting too much.” It’s texting from panic. Panic turns every message into a demand:
        <em>“Prove you’re here. Prove I matter. Prove I’m safe.”</em> This test helps you spot exactly which loop you’re in—so
        you can choose a message that gets respect, not just a reply.
      </p>
