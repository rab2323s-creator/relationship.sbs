      <p class="muted">A practical guide to reduce texting anxiety, stop spirals, and communicate like a secure person.</p>

      <h2>Why this topic gets searched so much</h2>
      <p>Most people don’t search relationship advice when things are calm. They search when something is uncertain: a slow reply, mixed signals, a recurring argument, or a breakup that won’t stop hurting. Google often rewards pages that answer the intent directly—so this guide is written to be practical, specific, and easy to apply.</p>

      <h2>What to watch for</h2>
      <p>Look for patterns, not one isolated moment. A single bad day is normal. A repeated pattern (inconsistent contact, poor repair after conflict, disrespect, or avoidance of clarity) is what predicts outcomes. When you identify the pattern, you can decide: build skills together, set boundaries, or move on.</p>

      <h2>What to do next (a simple 3-step plan)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Name the issue without blame:</strong> “When X happens, I feel Y.”</li>
        <li><strong>Make a concrete request:</strong> “Can we do Z?” (specific, measurable).</li>
        <li><strong>Watch actions for 2 weeks:</strong> consistency matters more than promises.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Examples you can copy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“I like you. I’m looking for consistency—can we plan a time to talk this week?”</li>
        <li>“When conversations end abruptly, I feel confused. Can we close with a quick ‘talk later’?”</li>
        <li>“I need a pause. I’ll come back at 8:30 and continue.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Red flags vs normal stress</h2>
      <p><strong>Normal stress</strong> looks like a mistake plus repair. <strong>Red flags</strong> look like repeated disrespect, intimidation, manipulation, or refusal to take accountability. If you feel unsafe, prioritize safety and support.</p>
