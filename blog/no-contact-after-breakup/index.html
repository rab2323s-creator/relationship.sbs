      <h1>No Contact After a Breakup: A Practical Timeline (and the Common Traps)</h1>
      <p class="muted">“No contact” is not a trick to get them back. It’s a structure that protects your nervous system long enough for clarity to return. Here’s when it helps, when it backfires, and what to do day-by-day.</p>

      <h2>What “no contact” actually means</h2>
      <p>In plain terms: you stop initiating messages, calls, “checking in,” and social-media monitoring. If you must coordinate logistics (kids, leases, items), you keep communication <strong>short, factual, and scheduled</strong>.</p>

      <h2>When no contact works best</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You’re stuck in a loop</strong> of texting → anxiety → rereading → more texting.</li>
        <li><strong>The breakup is fresh</strong> and every interaction resets the pain.</li>
        <li><strong>There were boundary violations</strong> (lying, disrespect, on/off confusion).</li>
        <li><strong>You need to stop negotiating</strong> with someone who already chose to leave.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When it doesn’t work (or needs a modified version)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Co-parenting / legal logistics</strong>: use “low contact” with a fixed channel and time window.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety concerns</strong>: prioritize safety planning and documented communication.</li>
        <li><strong>You’re using it as a test</strong>: “If they love me they’ll chase.” That keeps you dependent on their behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A realistic timeline you can follow</h2>
      <h3>Days 1–7: stabilize (don’t negotiate)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Delete shortcuts to chats, mute notifications, and remove “quick access” triggers.</li>
        <li>Write a one-paragraph “truth note” about why it ended. Read it when urges hit.</li>
        <li>Replace the habit: when you want to text, do a 90-second reset (walk, cold water, breathing).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weeks 2–4: regain clarity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stop “investigating” their socials. Curiosity is normal; feeding it is optional.</li>
        <li>Make a micro-plan: sleep, meals, movement, one social plan per week.</li>
        <li>Identify your pattern: anxious chasing vs avoidant shutdown. (Take the <a href="/tests/attachment-style/">Attachment Style Snapshot</a>.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Weeks 4–8: decide, don’t drift</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want closure, plan <strong>one</strong> conversation with a clear goal.</li>
        <li>If reconciliation is a possibility, define standards: consistency, repair skills, boundaries.</li>
        <li>If you’re still stuck, work on conflict skills (see <a href="/tests/conflict-style/">Conflict Style</a> and <a href="/blog/fair-fighting-rules/">Fair fighting rules</a>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The five traps that break no contact</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>“One last message”</strong> turns into ten.</li>
        <li><strong>Checking socials</strong> (it counts as contact in your brain).</li>
        <li><strong>Late-night texting</strong> when regulation is lowest.</li>
        <li><strong>Fishing for signals</strong>: likes, views, indirect posts.</li>
        <li><strong>Using friends as spies</strong> (keeps you emotionally attached).</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>If you must text (logistics only): scripts</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Option A:</strong> “I can do Tuesday 6–7pm for pickup. Please confirm.”</p>
        <p><strong>Option B:</strong> “Let’s keep communication to email for logistics. Thanks.”</p>
        <p class="muted">Keep it boring. No emotions. No hidden questions.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What to do instead of texting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Write the text in Notes, don’t send it. Wait 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Use a “replacement click”: open <a href="/tools/text-decoder/">Text Decoder</a> or read <a href="/blog/stop-overthinking-texts/">Stop overthinking texts</a>.</li>
        <li>Build one boundary you’ll keep next time (see <a href="/blog/healthy-boundaries-script/">Boundary scripts</a>).</li>
      </ul>
